    "reviewBody": "If the director of this independent film tried to make us feel really confused, like the main character, he did it wonderfully. There are only a few movies like this one, the kind of movies that makes you pay attention to every minute of it. Obviously that doesn&apos;t work all the time, but this case is the exception. Really well directed with a wonderful photography and excellent cast. The main actors&apos; performances are great. We really root for the guy as we hate the ones who try to take advantage of him.\n\nOriginal films like this one always stand out. Perhaps it didn&apos;t caught much attention at first but now it is in an important position at the IMDb top 250 and that means that most the people recognize great movies when they see them.\n\nAs I said before, this movie is a little confusing because it runs backwards while the black and white scenes run in chronological order. But that wasn&apos;t a cheap trick to make the movie more &quot;intelectual&quot;, it was its strength. A rare film that shouldn&apos;t be missed.",

    "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve seen a lot of hate for Tenet, but I honestly believe the movie will age very well, and a lot of the people who hate it now will come to realize just how ahead of its time it is. I will admit that it prioritizes concept over plot and character, and hard-to-hear dialogue has become a recurring problem for Nolan. But the movie is great, and I like it more the more I think about it. You don&apos;t need to be super smart to understand it, as some diehard Nolan fans claim, but I believe you do need to be fascinated enough by the philosophy of time to make it a pleasant experience. Without that, I think the movie will bore you and that boredom will probably lead you to miss some key points needed to fill in the puzzle. Filling in the puzzle doesn&apos;t mean you&apos;ll like it though, because this movie is an experimental thriller disguised as a blockbuster, which is not what people expected.\n\nHey, maybe I&apos;m wrong, but I expect the love for this movie will grow over the years.",

But and it is a big but, for a story I left feeling let down. This is no saving private Ryan or stunning epic as the critics would suggest. \n\nI am no history buff and I am from the other side of the world but even I know the story of Dunkirk and this just didn&apos;t live up the epic nature of the true story. \n\nThe characters don&apos;t do the story justice, the timelines are blurred and the epic nature is missing. There are some great visual scenes and a few uplifting moments but it just didn&apos;t feel tied together.\n\nMy rating is probably a bit harsh but I just don&apos;t rate this a one of the great efforts of story telling. If you didn&apos;t know anything of the actual events at Dunkirk this would leave you having missed the epic nature of what was achieved with 700 private boats over 8 days back in 1940.",

    "reviewBody": "After eight years in seclusion, Batman resurfaces to face Bane, a mastermind bent on destroying Gotham and has ties to Bruce Wayne&apos;s past. Christopher Nolan&apos;s conclusion to his Dark Knight trilogy should be treated as a wrap up rather than a third installment. Despite many new characters being introduced, even their conflicts and motives are derived from events that occurred in the previous two films. Such an approach could be seen as a weakness, since the conflict could just end up being sort of a rematch rather than moving the story forward; however, Nolan&apos;s approach works terrificly. Over an hour is shot in stunning IMAX, but the film is more touching than it is intense\u0085 and that&apos;s its best quality. Hardy steps in as the genius mercenary Bane, who is slightly bigger, slightly stronger and slightly smarter than Batman, thus making him a challenge best suited for the grand finale. The Joker works best as Batman&apos;s arch-nemesis since they are polar opposites, with The Joker standing for everything Batman stands against. Two-Face works best as Batman&apos;s most tragic enemy because Harvey Dent is very much like Bruce Wayne\u0085 the only difference is: Dent copes with his tragedy through revenge rather than seeking justice as Wayne did. Bane works best as Batman&apos;s most challenging villain because of his physical and mental superiority\u2014forget the Bane you saw in &quot;BATMAN &amp; ROBIN&quot;. Nolan carefully chose all his villains in the series wisely and executed them perfectly. Hardy had big shoes to fill following Ledger&apos;s posthumous Oscar winning performance; while Bane is no Joker, Hardy does a satisfying job and should not be compared to Ledger&apos;s performance as they are completely different roles. It is Michael Caine, however, that delivers the most memorable and touching performance of the entire film. A wonderful conclusion to a wonderful trilogy.\n\n**** (out of four)",

    "name": "Over-hyped Masala Flick",
    "reviewBody": "Ghajini only goes on to show what hype can do for a movie.\n\nThe movie may well be on its way to become one of the biggest grosser in Bollywood. But at best, it matches up to an above-average Sunny Deol flick. Had the movie not featured Aamir Khan it would not have been nowhere close to what it is now.\n\nBollywood has had a history where many a venture has sunk despite hype but what worked for Ghajini was a sustained and immaculately planned publicity campaign. That it was Aamir&apos;s sole movie in the whole year, and was coming a whole year after his poignant Taare Zameen Par, already had the nation in good anticipation. This combined with the publicity given to Aamir&apos;s (over-hyped) physique and supposed eight-pack took the hype to newer altitudes. The marketing team also made sure the bulked-up Aamir was visible in malls and public places. Days before the release, one could see the once-considered reticent Aamir giving interviews on every possible show on every possible channel. Newspapers and websites were flooded with Aamir&apos;s 13 month rigorous training to get his look. Also, to engage a larger segment of the audience, romantic promos augmented the initial action-oriented posters.\n\nThe end result of it all had to be a bumper opening for Ghajini. Needless to say, all this wouldn&apos;t have worked so well for another actor; but Aamir&apos;s hysteria is unparalleled and his fan following spans all sections of gender, class and religion. The loose ends of Shahrukh&apos;s &quot;Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi&quot; also proved beneficial for this film and the &quot;thinking&quot; audience thronged the halls to see if Aamir had fared better. For the rest, who weren&apos;t really the star&apos;s fans, they went anyways to see what all the hype was all about! So how did I find it? The film is loud and the background score louder. This morning I concurred with my colleague who told me that he left the hall with a heavy head after watching this film. Even the overall music, barring a song or two, is forgettable and below-average by Rahman&apos;s standards. Majority of the songs stand out of the story and merely extend the length of the film.\n\nIf action happens to be your genre of choice, you will enjoy the punches and villains being banged on walls and windows. If not, then you&apos;d be sitting at the wrong place for those parts of the movie. What however holds your attention is the narrative; the director manages to engage you through the entire film. When the gore goes heavy, a romantic flashback alters the tone and pace of the movie. In this regard, the editing is slick and crisp. So even if the film could put some of you to sleep, it won&apos;t give you the opportunity to yawn! In terms of performances, Asin wows with her refreshing act. She lights up the screen and (due apologies to Aamir&apos;s fans) steals the thunder from right under the actor&apos;s nose. It&apos;s a pity she didn&apos;t get her due with the superstar taking most of the credit. You wait for her to come on screen; be it simple acts of helping people around her or faking up her romance with the business tycoon \u0096 she portrays the character of affable Kalpana with \u00e9lan. In fact, it is the flashback sequences in which she appears, that were most enjoyable.\n\nIt is surprising that Aamir, known for choosing his films very selectively, opted for this South Indian remake. Even though his character is central to the film, he doesn&apos;t have too many dialogues. As a guy suffering from short term memory loss, he shows his frustration to a degree but doesn&apos;t have much else to do than beat up anyone and everyone coming in his way. Perhaps, the director could have focused more on the confusion and tribulations he faced due to his problem. As the business tycoon in flashbacks, his witty act makes you laugh. But in one of the scenes when giving interviews to international media, he didn&apos;t sound convincing as a magnate. All in all, his performance was satisfactory in the context of the film. He didn&apos;t break any new ground with this, as some people claim. As for achieving the macho look, I don&apos;t think with the support available these days it is such a Herculean task for an actor known for his sincerity and perfectionism.\n\nAs the bad guy Ghajini, Pradeep Rawat disappointed; he tried hard to mouth Haryanvi dialogues but was neither effective nor convincing. Perhaps, the movie would have been elevated to another level had the villainy act been more polished.\n\nThe cinematography by Ravi K. Chandran was par excellence. And be it the exotic locales of the Guzarish song or dark shots of the climax sequence, he has shot them all brilliantly. The action sequences have a South Indian influence even though some of them are executed well.\n\nGhajini, as a one time watch, was entertaining even for someone like me not particularly into action movies or Aamir Khan. But the cult status to which it has been elevated is definitely not justified. It is a clearly over-hyped and has garnered undue credit than what it is worth. I&apos;m sure people had higher expectations from Aamir but for fear of being sounding different, no one wants to admit that.",

Ledger is the nightmare villain, twisted, evil, unapologetic, irrational, completely void of a moral compass\n\n*quality of writing* #10 perfection - one of those movies you wish you could have a memory edit in order to watch again and again\n\n*quality of intangibles* #8 excellent - visual is on point, dark gloomy Gotham, perfect setting for a hero to operate and succeed from the shadows very good - music and sound puts viewers in the mood and anticipating the next intense scene",

    "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it&apos;s even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.\n\nIt&apos;s not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it&apos;s a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.\n\nBasically, it&apos;s a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.\n\nThis is one movie guaranteed to have you thinking about it when it&apos;s over!",

I&apos;ve played the likes of this game in &quot;Indiana Jones and the Emperor&apos;s Tomb&quot; and &quot;Obi Wan Kenobi&quot; (hey, this brings my screen name full circle with video games!) and love them for the sheer challenge involving coordination and problem solving. &quot;Batman Begins&quot; isn&apos;t quite at the same level in terms of challenge. It often uses visual cues to tip you off, while the latter games leave you mostly looking for the objects by yourself. But it makes up for it out of the sheer fun! One of the lesser things about Batman that I love are his use of the grapple gun, and there are plenty of opportunities to use it. Also the whole &quot;predator&quot; feel of it is very empowering. The drama comes out high as well.\n\nPerhaps it&apos;s both naive and cynical of me to love the game out of theme (like you haven&apos;t caught onto that yet) and ease of wielding power throughout the game, but I think everyone is entitled to choose an entertainment genre they can play the simpleton to.",

One day, he follows this man, Cobb, who turns the tables and confronts Bill, who breaks down and confesses what he&apos;s up to.  \n\nCobb is a burglar and he takes Bill along on a few jobs to teach him the ropes.  Both men are voyeurs of a sort and a bond begins to grow between the two of them. \n\nBut there&apos;s an ulterior motive for Cobb nurturing this relationship, and it all ties in very smartly at the end.  No, I won&apos;t spoil it but this is a very cool movie and I&apos;m beginning to think Christopher Nolan is a genius.\n\nIf you like suspense films with surprise endings, this one is a must see.",

However as he slowly begins to track the bug down and trap it, things chance dramatically but the man continues his course of action. Before Nolan hit the big time with several successful motion pictures, he made this short while studying English at University in London. It is rather atmospheric and is enjoyable for that reason.\n\nThe plot is interesting at the start and has a nice twist at the end which is pretty obvious once you see it being set up, but this isn&apos;t too much of a problem because there are only a few seconds between set up and delivery, so you&apos;re not wasting time being led somewhere you have already arrived. It is very much a student film as it thinks it is cleverer than it is and it seems like the sort of idea you have when you think that nobody else would ever think the same way \u0096 but this is just an observation, not so much an attack.\n\nIn terms of atmosphere the majority of the film really works; grainy black and white, dark rooms with bright intrusive light spread sparingly across the room and &apos;things&apos; moving rapidly around our main man. It does just enough to feel like it is building to something but not so much that the ending will be a disappointment.\n\nOverall it is worth seeing mainly because of what its director has gone on to do since this. As a short film in its own right it is atmospheric enough and with an interesting premise to the point that it is worth a few minutes of your time; but the ending is not as &apos;out of the blue&apos; or as clever as Nolan must have thought it was at the time \u0096 happily he has gone on to much bigger and better things since!"

    "description": "In Zack Snyder&apos;s Justice League, determined to ensure Superman\u2019s (Henry Cavill) ultimate sacrifice was not in vain, Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) aligns forces with Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) with plans to recruit a team of metahumans to protect the world from an approaching threat of catastrophic proportions. The task proves more difficult than Bruce imagined, as each of the recruits must face the demons of their own pasts to transcend that which has held them back, allowing them to come together, finally forming an unprecedented league of heroes. Now united, Batman (Affleck), Wonder Woman (Gadot), Aquaman (Jason Momoa), Cyborg (Ray Fisher), and The Flash (Ezra Miller) may be too late to save the planet from Steppenwolf, DeSaad, and Darkseid and their dreadful intentions."

    "name": "Really Great Comic Book Movie!",
    "reviewBody": "This is the first time watching any version of &quot;Justice League&quot; and I gotta say I really enjoyed it! I loved the six part plus epilogue format as it felt more like reading a series of comic books. Everything was solid in this movie. From the special effects, to the story, the action, it was all what I&apos;d expect out of a pretty darn good comic book. I felt like every member of the Justice League team was explored to a good enough degree, although I felt Aquaman was the least interesting of the characters, and Daredevil was a pure joy! That scene with the resume, hot dog, and car accident was as memorable as you get! I really liked the story of the cyborg too... with the whole father plot going on. Excellent! Superman was pretty interesting to see when he just regains consciousness and is a bit confused about what&apos;s going on and operating on pure instinct. I felt that was executed quite well, though the &quot;cure&quot; was a tad predictable. Yes, this movie had many predictable moments but really is that such a bad thing? Sometimes a story can be classic and that&apos;s fine. We don&apos;t always need twists here and there.\n\nAnyways, now I&apos;m curious to watch the original Justice League to see if it&apos;s really all that bad. I honestly can&apos;t see how it could be good with so much cut out of it! I even gotta say, the ending of the movie had me wanting more.\n\nCould DC be onto something here? I mean, I kind of love the serious, darker-than-Marvel old fashioned tone here. Not too too dark but just right... not corny... the right balance for these types of characters and storylines... Just feels right for DC. In a time when Marvel has sort of lost its shine, and played itself out, I&apos;d really love to see the DC universe take form! I want more Batman (played by Ben Affleck), I want more Superman (played by Henry Cavill) and all the others. I want them back for sure! Gimme more!\n\nMy only main criticism? I wish this were widescreen, seriously. It&apos;s jarring to watch in &quot;full screen&quot; mode and sure I get it... this is just how it was filmed and meant to be imax blah blah blah but seriously... wish they thought of this beforehand. I think it would look better in widescreen. Nobody can argue this movie benefits from two black bars on the sides.\n\nA second watch I might upgrade it to 9/10. As a comic book lover, having watched these childhood heroes and villains treated so very respectfully... I gotta say: yes! A great comic book movie. It did what it needed to do!\n\nAnd then here comes my other slight criticism to the franchise as a whole. I wish we could have gotten just one or two movies of Superman being a good guy. He was a bit too emo in the first Superman film... and never really had a chance to just save people. Like, you have to know who Superman is or have read the comics to really understand him, and this DC series sort of just assumes you know him and add this on top. If this were the only movie series containing Superman, he would not really be the Superman we know and love. That said, I&apos;m intrigued by what might be coming next with the evil dream Superman. So I&apos;m still in. I just wish we had a couple more Superman-being-good-and-saving-the-cat type of movies if you know what I mean.\n\nAnyways, let&apos;s see where things go. I have a feeling that the success and reception of this movie might lead to more goodness!",

There wasn&apos;t enough back story for casual fans to understand what was going on, so not a lot of people could really enjoy it. But luckily they released the extended version. While it makes the movie longer, it explains so much and helps keep fans who aren&apos;t that familiar with the DC universe keep up with the flow of the movie.

His highly controversial experiments have made him the prime target of anti-technology extremists who will do whatever it takes to stop him. In their attempt to destroy Will, they inadvertently become the catalyst for him to succeed. For his wife Evelyn and best friend Max Waters, both fellow researchers, the question is not if they can...but if they should. Their worst fears are realized as Will&apos;s thirst for knowledge evolves into a seemingly omnipresent quest for power, to what end is unknown. The only thing that is becoming terrifyingly clear is there may be no way to stop him."

But, as Will begins to grow and expand, can his wife Evelyn and Will&apos;s friends stop him before the Will they knew is completely gone?\n\nI find it truly pathetic how many people are hating on this movie, and for some of the wrong reasons. I did go into this movie with high expectations and was disappointed, but there was still a lot to salvage from that was good. But first thing&apos;s first: the bad. Transcendence has a fantastic story and great concepts, but the way it was delivered and structured was incredibly poor and muddled. If you split the film in half instead of thirds, the second half of the film is incredible and ends how it should, but the first half suffers from time gaps, some left out character development and poor pacing. But, this is really all that&apos;s bad. \n\nThe decent but disappointing aspects of the film are the ideas. The film pitches grand and epic thoughts that grow, but the ideas it preaches are never fully realized, at least the majority of them. Then, the script by Jack Paglen suffered from inconsistencies and random plot elements that did not really need to be there, or should have been examined further (like RIFT). \n\nNow, the good and great. Wally&apos;s direction was superb; he really knew what he was doing after working with Christopher Nolan for so long. Pfister&apos;s style and unique eye helped save this movie from being a total disaster, especially when it came to the action, the way the camera moved with the scene and the characters or just the environment itself. The acting was great, too, especially Paul Bettany in the supporting role as Max, Will and Evelyn Caster&apos;s friend and fellow scientist. He brought heart and emotion from the other side of the spectrum, having an objective and subjective eye on the situation, with the other (completely subjective) side being from Evelyn&apos;s point of view. Rebecca Hall was great as Evelyn, a researcher clouded by her love for Will, and challenged in deciding whether or not the thing Will says he is, is actually Will or not. Johnny Depp was good, but it wasn&apos;t until the end of the film when the audience feels emotionally attached to him, as he&apos;s usually an emotionless AI, projected on screens and glass. The visual effects were top-notch and some of the best of the year hands-down, and the musical score by Mychael Danna was haunting, beautiful and intense when it needed to be.\n\nTranscendence is an actually good movie that deserves more credit than the immense crap it&apos;s getting. And to those who keep comparing it to the B-movie &quot;Lawnmower Man,&quot; it&apos;s different. Sure, there are brief similarities (melding man with machine), but that&apos;s it. It&apos;s an original take on the &quot;technology-will-destroy-humanity&quot; cautionary tale, and it&apos;s a disturbing one that does have some hopeful (and resonating) humanity after the mayhem and chaos has settled. I hope Wally Pfister gets to tackle another big sci-fi film, but one with a different, more experienced writer.",

While people who don&apos;t enjoy the Nolan brand of cinema will mark Insomnia as their favorite from Nolan. Simply because, this movie is a remake and while has many of Nolan&apos;s signature styles, it is not as evident as it is in his other superior works (IMHO).\n\nNolan&apos;s movies (from Following to Inception) is built around the concept of duality. Insomnia has a similar theme running through it, that of Al Pacino&apos;s character living the life of a honest role-model while still doing things reprehensible, thus showing two sides of life. Al Pacino and Robin Williams are in supreme form and the cinematography by Wally Pfister is gorgeous. But the &apos;quickness&apos; that is associated with other Nolan movies (even BB) is visibly absent in this one. It is by no means a bad movie, but the slow burn of the thriller does dampen the effect. Not a must watch, but an intriguing thriller that well matches its Swedish inspiration.",

I don&apos;t really write reviews, but felt compelled to for this one, because it needs to be seen, needs to be talked about, and something needs to be done about this issue, BOTTOMLINE.

Towards the end, I had to resist the temptation to fast forward. The writing was unoriginal and more silly than funny. Some scenes seem to have been cut in at random, with no relation to the rest of the script. The B-list cameos served only to briefly distract from the bad script. The only thing paranormal about the movie was the notion that a guy like Farley could get a girlfriend as hot as Carly Craig. Speaking of Craig, I&apos;m a big fan, but her performance was so monotone that it barely qualified as acting. She should have sharted all over this movie. It would have helped.",

It consisted of people in the foyer of the cinema giving their review on the film. This is usually a sign that the film is rubbish. After watching the film, i can only guess they were paid to read out fake reviews. There is no way it can be there opinion.\n\nwhat to say about the film? Unfunny, badly structured, nonsensical plot, a protagonist that you want to fail. You wonder what his motivation is to get out of bed and go on the journey.\n\nOne plus is the actors are actually quite good. They did the best they could with the script.\n\nThe script is so bad it will make you angry. It clearly has had no script doctoring at all. I would guess it was a first draft and they just went to the filming stage.\n\nI would love to give it a zero but IMDb wont allow me.\n\nApparently, according to the trailer, i will be quoting this film all night.\n\nI will sign off now with a quote...right, i&apos;m off for a sh*t",

    "reviewBody": "Don Jon (2013) \n\n*** 1/2 (out of 4)\n\nJoseph Gordon-Levitt wrote, director and stars as Jon, a twenty-something man who loves women but what he loves even more is watching porn. He meets Barbara (Scarlett Johansson) who demands that he gives it up for her. DON JON isn&apos;t the greatest film ever made but I will say that I don&apos;t recall ever watching a movie that was so confident. Confidence is something most people lack and even most brass movies lack it but DON JON certainly isn&apos;t afraid to say what it wants to and stick by it. Having a romantic comedy that says watching porn is better than being with women and then tells you why that&apos;s the case is something incredibly rare. What&apos;s even rarer is that this type of subject is usually just played for cheap laughs but here there&apos;s a complete story wrapped around it that asks a lot of questions, gives a lot of answers and as I said, is 100% confident about itself. The confidence just really jumps off the screen unlike any movie I&apos;ve ever seen and that&apos;s where the original aspect of this film comes. There have been countless movies that downplay women but this one here just does so in such a fresh and original way that you can&apos;t help but enjoy it. It also is very smart about guys, their mentality on sex and various other issues. Gordon-Levitt does a wonderful job all around but especially in the acting department. As the writer he certainly knows this character very well but it still takes a very strong performance to get that to the screen and the actor does a fabulous job. Johansson also turns in her greatest work outside of a Woody Allen picture and Tony Danza is very memorable in his supporting bit as is Glenne Headly and Julianne Moore. The screenplay is certainly dirty and covers a lot of topics but the film never crosses the offensive line. The main reason it doesn&apos;t cross the line is that it remains smart no matter what it&apos;s saying and how dirty it&apos;s being said. DON JON is certainly a refreshing film that should get one excited thinking that Gordon-Levitt could turn into someone to keep your eye on not just as an actor but as a writer and director."

    "reviewBody": "I had the good fortune of attending the ShockFest Film Festival on Nov 16, 2012 and watched the new film The Black Dahlia Haunting. I enjoy a good scare, and usually settle in at night with a good horror movie although I also can get absorbed when watching a supernatural thriller. I also happen to enjoy retrospective accounts of notable infamous events. Imagine my surprise to see all three delivered simultaneously with confidence by the film&apos;s writer and director, Brandon Slagle. In less capable hands the script could have become convoluted but Slagle helmed the project successfully.\n\nSince I have been a paranormal researcher for many years, I was curious to see how that aspect of the story would be handled. One of the film&apos;s stars, Britt Griffith, is an actual paranormal investigator and has no doubt seen how a haunting can affect those who live with discarnate personalities. I have known Britt for several years, and was curious to see his portrayal of Dr. Owen, one of the key characters in the movie. His pivotal role required a range that any performer would see as a challenge and he rose to the occasion.\n\nIn fact, each of the cast members did admirable jobs and I could not help but notice that as the movie neared it&apos;s climax, some in the audience began to gasp and some people seemed frozen in their seats. The movie has a story that at times moved some people to tears, and prompted others to cover their eyes. There are some plot twist I didn&apos;t see coming, and some scenes could be seared into your memory. Alexis Iacono&apos;s performance as Elizabeth Short reminds us that at the center of ghost story is an unforgettable spirit.",

THE TREE OF LIFE is not a conventional film in any shape or form. Having some insight into the film would better prepare a viewer.

    "reviewBody": "I saw this short at &quot;Movies at the Mill&quot; on September 22, 2012 in Easton, Pennsylvania. Though it had a nice feel, the story relied on a bit of silliness instead of something witty.\n\nThe acting was fine, but Rojas was a complete standout as Audrey Hepburn. She truly embraced the real life natural beauty, and completely captured her in mind and body. Her delivery was exceptional, and Levin&apos;s short, based on Keller&apos;s script (she also played the role of Grace Kelly), is worth watching simply for her fabulous performance.\n\nI&apos;m not sure why the element of the police officer was brought into play, and why costumer Betsey Potter seemed to have no concept of what kind of sidearm he would have during that time period. \n\nRegardless, the story is &quot;cute&quot; when it could have been wonderful.",

This is because it&apos;s always fun to watch the cast and crew talk about their experiences filming a particular movie and working with their co-stars as well as the crew of that particular movie. In addition, it&apos;s also fun to see what happened behind the scenes during the filming of a particular movie, such as takes or bloopers. Anytime I watch one of these specials on DVD or special edition VHS, I always look forward to hearing from and seeing the cast and crew. Before I wrap this up, I&apos;d like to say that this wis a great show that goes behind the scenes of a movie with the cast and crew.

They have celebrity guests and the people that are in the news as guests so they can tell their stories on the show. During the week the show is hosted by Mary Hart, Mark Steins, Jan Carl, Vanessa Minnillo, Steven Cojocaru, Leornard Maltin, Carlos Ponce, Paula Abdul, and Kevin Frazier! All of these hosts in My opinion are very talented. What I like about the show is that the hosts go into many details in the news and such. So if you are watching television during the week and want to watch the Hollywood and celebrity news in detail then I suggest that you watch Entertainment Tonight today!"

    "reviewBody": "This year I managed to watch the live telecast on the Cable TV channel Dubai One as opposed to intermittently streaming over the &apos;Net or even simply waiting for the results to show up on IMDb! As a show, it left a lot to be desired \u2013 with host Ellen De Generes (returning after her 2007 engagement where Martin Scorsese was also a contender) disappearing for moments on end and only lazily putting in the occasional \u2013 and hardly side-splitting \u2013 quip (at her best, perhaps, when mentioning Jonah Hill&apos;s anatomy as seen in THE WOLF OF WALL STREET). Her antics included taking orders for pizza to be delivered and distributed around among the nominees\u0085which really showed up, and later taking up a collection to pay for it!; she also took a large selfie of herself, Meryl Streep and everyone nearby! Still, her constantly being in the aisle or indeed sitting next to the nominees themselves was an act that quickly grew stale and displayed a lack of ideas more than anything else.\n\nAs usual, the list of presenters was a sorry sight: these included a few youthful non-entities (Zac Efron, Channing Tatum), some uneasy-looking stars unwilling to lay down their boots (Harrison Ford, John Travolta) and a couple of old-timers who rather than adding to the lustre made a spectacle of themselves by exposing just how far gone they were to millions of spectators (Kim Novak, Sidney Poitier)! The latter two were especially embarrassing to watch: what was husky-voiced and Botox-riddled Novak doing presenting the Animation categories, and what was the point of having Poitier (who was leaning on Angelina Jolie all the time) present the Best Direction Oscar when it was obviously not going to Steve McQueen (if anything, they should have had them replace Will Smith in the Best Picture category thus allowing Jolie to give the Oscar to partner Brad Pitt)?! Another irritating presence was that of a seemingly tipsy Liza Minnelli, who was there (with two of her siblings) to watch pop-star Pink cover her mum Judy Garland&apos;s signature tune &quot;Over The Rainbow&quot; on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the release of THE WIZARD OF OZ \u2013 I would think they are the only surviving relatives of actors who were alive in 1939, known as Hollywood&apos;s greatest year ever! With respect to the &quot;In Memoriam&quot; section, I was disappointed to see Philip Seymour Hoffman take the spot that ought to have been reserved for Peter O&apos;Toole \u2013 and, how come some &quot;inventor&quot; no one has ever heard of rates a mention but not comic Jonathan Winters, master Hungarian film-maker Miklos Jancso, prolific writer/director/actor Bryan Forbes or film noir stalwart Audrey Totter (on the other hand, Harold Ramis got remembered twice, firstly by way of presenter and former colleague Bill Murray)?! Having a theme for the whole show is silly in the first place but to choose &quot;Heroes&quot; and include clips from recent superhero movies (as if we needed to be reminded that they were still being made!) - but none from the earlier SUPERMAN franchise with the late Christopher Reeve?! To add insult to injury, they included clips from classic movies like CASABLANCA (1942), IT&apos;S A WONDERFUL LIFE (1946), BEN-HUR (1959), LAWRENCE OF ARABIA and TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD (1962)...seriously?! \n\nWith respect to how the awards went, I was obviously let down since my top three films of the year \u2013 in order of merit, American HUSTLE, THE WOLF OF WALL STREET and NEBRASKA \u2013 all went home empty-handed! Conversely, 12 YEARS A SLAVE and GRAVITY were the most awarded (3 and 7 Oscars respectively) but my least favourites! GRAVITY&apos;s technical categories sweep killed the suspense, naturally, but there were a few surprising upsets regardless: I cannot fathom why the Best Supporting Actress Oscar went to Lupita Nyong&apos;o, who had only one good scene in the entire film; the Best Adapted Screenplay also went to 12 YEARS A SLAVE over the no-less-reprehensible but far more inventive THE WOLF OF WALL STREET; ditto for the Original Screenplay category \u2013 the loss of American HUSTLE (which can only be explained by the plot&apos;s derivative nature) proved Spike Jonze&apos;s gain with the futuristic and bittersweet HER; another unexpected win was FROZEN&apos;s for Best Song over U2&apos;s &quot;Ordinary Love&quot; for that Mandela movie (I am sure Bono was itching to deliver a heartfelt speech about the recently-deceased South African leader!); as I said, Alfonso Cuaron was so sure of his eventual directorial win that, when he was named earlier for Best Editing, he did not even deliver a speech (I was actually praying he would subsequently lose and see him left with egg on his face for failing to put in his two words when he had the chance)! As ever, a number of speeches were well-prepared and hit the audience in the right spots \u2013 notably all the acting categories and Matthew McConaughey&apos;s in particular\u0085but Steve McQueen (what gall to keep such a name, I must say!)&apos;s tongue-tied roll-call of gratitude (sounding like Leonardo Di Caprio&apos;s drug-fuelled phone conversation from THE WOLF OF WALL STREET!) was not a high spot, yet the heavy-set guy made up for it by leaping with joy at the conclusion of his triumph for co-producing the year&apos;s Best Picture!"

    "reviewBody": "I have fond childhood memories of the Dave Garroway &quot;Today&quot; show from the early to mid-50&apos;s. I watched it every morning as I was preparing for school. I enjoyed seeing all those people in New York City standing in the street looking in the window as they were being shot live by the &quot;Today&quot; cameras. Members of the crowd held up signs with such homilies as hello, Mom, or Bruce, or folks back home, or whoever was watching their first appearance on national TV. Whenever the camera panned them, they would do crazy things such as distorting their faces, jumping up and down, screeching, winking an eye, and incessantly waving as if they had just landed on the moon. \n\nThe early &quot;Today&quot; show centered on the eccentric personality of Dave Garroway, who became almost a cult figure to some of his viewers. His signature trademark was to hold his right hand up at the end of the program and softly proclaim, &quot;Peace.&quot; This tall, bespectacled host was certainly different than others of his ilk. He tended to be moody yet conversational while drinking a cup of coffee. Dave&apos;s nemesis was the so-called co-host J. Fred Muggs, a spoiled and pampered chimp. Obvious to viewers was the enmity Dave felt toward the chimp. Also obvious: the feeling was mutual. Dave and the chimp pretended that it was all in fun. One reason for this pretense was the popularity of the chimp over Dave. Dave let the chimp make a monkey of him because it kept the ratings up. \n\nAlmost as popular as Dave and the chimp were the other members of the &quot;Today&quot; morning team. Jack Lescoulie gave the sports, served as reporter, and participated in the hijinks with J. Fred and Dave from time to time. He was a colorful character with a gift of gab who did his job well. He would sit in for Dave when needed. The news anchor, Frank Blair, was the most laid back of the &quot;Today&quot; staff. He was droll in his humor but Like Jack Lescoulie often participated in the fun and games. As I recall he also gave the weather.\n\nDave was gifted in several ways. His intellect enabled him to communicate his ideas and feelings with ease yet in a way that seemed informal and genuine. He conducted many of the best interviews of early television. He had an innate sense of what world work and what wouldn&apos;t work on early morning television when choosing guests and topics. Because of his tortured personal life, the gifts he possessed sadly began to wane till he was dropped by NBC and drifted into oblivion."

    "reviewBody": "60 Minutes seemed to be created in a time when America needed answers --in depth, hard hitting, guerrilla journalism about the inner dealings in Washington, Corporations, the Heart of America - the pulse of the world politic. The gold standard with many imitators, 60 Minutes could run as long as there is a need for finding the REAL truth in what effects us beyond the &quot;evening news&quot;.\n\n60 Minutes reporters asked the hard questions and KEPT asking the hard questions - many times revealing things publicly that we already suspected. It gave us facts, so that we could to draw our own conclusions and DO something about what we were presented.\n\n60 Minutes was a public service. A place to go to to find out what corruption is occurring and what happens while we sleep. It was also a place to see the best interviews with heads of countries we knew nothing about.\n\nNow in 2006, 60 Minutes is still around. A little bruised and battered for a younger generation who feels that news has to have a punch line like a variety show, and that there is no reason to care about what a corporation is doing beyond what Tina Fey jokes about on Saturday Night Live.\n\n60 Minutes is reality programming. Reality journalism and to be honest -as a young person, I had no reason to sit and watch. Reality news journalism is frightening. It was my &quot;parent&apos;s&quot; show.\n\nNow that I am older and look back, I was dead wrong and wished I had the sense I have now to pay more attention to 60 Minutes than I did.\n\nThe 60 Minutes Producers, Reporters and Researchers over the years put their lives and careers on the line many, many times - even against their own employer - CBS, CBS Corporate, etc, to try to bring us as straight of scoop as allowed - and break as much as they could - so we could all be informed and DO something about it. Bless them all.\n\nAnd then there is Andy Rooney. Everyone&apos;s &apos;cantancerous&apos; grand-dad. You may not agree with EVERYTHING he says, but when you do, it&apos;s time to do something about it.\n\nNow 60 Minutes has reached a turning point, they are at a time when they need to introduce new VETERAN journalists that would have the same heart, drive and ambition as the ones before them - and I hope they do. And there in lies the tale of 60 Minutes. Journalist who are vets in their field, and not high priced entertainment fluff who can read a teleprompter and cry on cue.\n\nI hope that I am wrong that Network Journalism is about the money and not about the story - the dirty, non-glamorous America and World news that lets us know that major corporations are dirt and will bowl over anyone for a buck, that American Farmers need help, that Presidents can&apos;t give a good interview and lie, that dictators need to be taken down before their ego gets any larger, that War is Hell, that regular food products can be dangerous, that addition occurs with additives that are secretly placed in places we wouldn&apos;t ave thought of, that Small Business is just as Bad as Corporations these days, that racism and sexism still exist, that one little person writing to Congress does not go unnoticed and that Congress and the Senate can abuse kids just like the guy down the street, etc. etc.\n\nThe World has NOT stopped turning -- and neither has 60 Minutes. As long as it is around, it keeps folks in check. And keeps other networks scrambling for competition. It&apos;s all good, for us.\n\nThere was a joke that went around the corporate community for many years. It went something like this: \n\n&quot;I know our company is doing okay because I don&apos;t see Mike Wallace or Ed Bradley coming into the building with a camera crew.&quot; \n\nExactly.",

Stick to the facts, please, on the topic I was interested in.\n\nIf you are willing to use the &apos;skip&apos; button frequently, or if you are interested in Neil&apos;s political views then this is a podcast for you.

Well explained but still difficult to understand for a lot of us as most of the material and science is still speculation, and it&apos;s just not the easiest thing to understand, we humble mortals. Nonetheless it&apos;s very interesting, certainly if you&apos;re interested in this subject. The narrator is Matthew McConaughey, lead actor from the movie Interstellar. He has a good and clear voice, easy to listen to. The images are of good quality, they&apos;re informative, sometimes stunning but certainly never boring. It&apos;s a nice documentary, a good entree before watching that brilliant movie Interstellar.",

The show is hilarious...from his ridiculous interviews, to The Word (&quot;Quitter&quot; on the Miers episode), to Colbert&apos;s aura of gravitas and his wicked wit, the show is nothing short of amazing. Better than the Daily Show any day. The only bad thing about The Colbert Report is the fact that it&apos;s only on four nights a week.\n\nAnd, to end on an awesome quote - On Harriet Miers: &quot;It is good you quit, because you are a quitter.

    "reviewBody": "Unlike the trilogy that we understood that wasn&apos;t planned in the first place, this piece of documentary about the process of making the best anti-hero reborn from ashes felt somehow incomplete.\n\nThe highlights include some very deeply statements of Guillermo del Toro and Michael Mann about the connection between cinema and audience own life, like Samuel Fuller said once. There&apos;s really amazing footage that alone makes this better than 60% of superhero movies. Plus behind the scenes cast with Cillian Murphy for Batman, among others, later picked for Crane.\n\nI recommend this for anyone fan of Batman or superhero movies. If you just saw the movies and don&apos;t know trivia/technical stuff this is great.\n\nBottom line is the soundtrack, as for the theatrical movies, are pieces from Hans Zimmer (sometimes with James Newton Howard) and some outtakes as well. Zimmer is a composer that needs no introduction. But digging into all the parts all aspects of making Dark Knight without even mention the mastermind behind that feeling you get in your spine is outrageous. Particularly in Dark Knight Rises, which frankly is the worse of the 3 (like Godfather 3 - movie stated by some critic on the film) and yet you can see George Miller using the some of it&apos;s formula on Mad Max Fury Road.\n\nSo yes, this could have been a more complete documentary behind scenes/making off and personal C. Nolan vision. Or you could put your new modern quality headphones and listen &quot;Imagine The Fire&quot; and you will feel why Dark Knight was so special, instantly.",

The likes of Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, William Friedkin, Christopher Nolan, Ben Affleck, Steve Carell, Michael Keaton and Martin Sheen talk about what the studio lot means to them as well as some other stories. Some of the best stuff deals with an actual tour of the lot where we get to see various locations including the set department, the construction zone, the costume department and even the last set remaining from CASABLANCA. It should go without saying but I don&apos;t see how any film buff is going to be disappointed in this thing because there&apos;s simply so many wonderful things to see. We also get some terrific stories including one from Sheen who talks about his love for James Dean and a touching story that I won&apos;t ruin for people. We also get Friedkin talking about trying to get someone to take the role of the mother in THE EXORCIST and why the top man felt the film could have been even bigger had Jane Fonda taken the part. If there&apos;s anything wrong with this documentary it&apos;s that the thing doesn&apos;t run long enough as there&apos;s just so much history to be told and we&apos;re not given too much time. Still, there are so many terrific things on display here that it&apos;s easy to recommend this."

However, if you&apos;ve ever wanted to know EVERYTHING about Batman&apos;s Batmobile, then this is most certainly the place to go. Despite being billed on the disc menu as a short feature, The Batmobile is a full hour long and goes into great depth on every version of the Batmobile, drawing from the comics, various cartoons, the 1940s film serial, 1960s television series, the four films released from 1989-1997, &amp; of course, the three films in The Dark Knight Trilogy. To this end, all sorts of figures make appearances, including film directors Tim Burton, Joel Schumacher &amp; Christopher Nolan; various actors, including Batmen Adam West &amp; Christian Bale along with former Robin Chris O&apos;Donnel; special effects experts; stunt drivers; &amp; comics creators. The finale involves five physical Batmobile vehicles, all from different Batman reimaginings, side-by-side for the first time in history, &amp; it is surprisingly emotional.\n\nI will say that I was caught off-guard several times by the length of this feature, having clicked it on expecting, well, the short feature advertised, &amp; one drawback of how comprehensive it is, is that there are parts that might be made redundant if you&apos;ve seen other Batmobile-related features, such as The Batmobile Revealed (from the Batman: The Movie disc), Beyond Batman: Building the Batmobile (from the Batman disc), Beyond Batman: Maximum Overdrive - The Vehicles of Batman &amp; Robin (from the Batman &amp; Robin disc), &amp; Batman: The Tumbler (from the Batman Begins disc). Still, that minor drawback doesn&apos;t mean that this film deserves any less praise for being the only totally comprehensive look at the complete history of the Batmobile, &amp; only makes those other featurettes obsolete.",

    "reviewBody": "this film is. It&apos;s about marking a turning point in the history of cinema and raising awareness about it. Yes, it&apos;s a subject that&apos;s been discussed and bitched about for what, 10 years now, ever since Lucas proclaimed that film is dead. But maybe for the first time it brings all the opposite opinions together. Side by side. (Loved the editing - it was just like watching a tennis match) And for people like myself, &apos;civilian&apos; moviegoers who while watching a movie often found themselves forgetting about the popcorn and instead wondering &apos;how it&apos;s made?&apos;, this film is like Christmas in June :) I mean, I&apos;ve read a bit about film making; I&apos;ve come across some of the terms and looked up their definition; I knew what a DP does; I&apos;ve scratched a bit the surface of the whole wide world of movie making. But to have the main processes explained clearly, precisely and in a language I could understand, all this in a one-and-a-half hour film, was like... like attending film school but without the (almost always compulsory) elitism and snobbery ;) :D \n\nAnd watching the documentary at a film festival was a special experience per se. It was shown in a small old-fashioned theater, with creaking seats and wood floors and velvet curtains and no air conditioning; and old theater where once I used to go watch old cinematheque movies in black-and-white. There was a bitter-sweet irony about it. The audience was formed mainly by film festival guests and film students; people with technical background in movie making, and a few lost souls like myself, who just wanted to watch the documentary we read so much about. And it was a joy to see them react to the technical jokes; to hear a few of them hoot when on the screen someone was talking about the operator and the DP losing their god-like status on the set, or to hear them snicker when Cameron rhetorically asks Reeves &apos;you&apos;ve been on a few sets in your life, haven&apos;t you?&apos; \n\nIt&apos;s a film about nostalgia and inevitability, with a very light note of sadness. \n\nBut this was just the first date, and I&apos;m quite taken with the film, so I&apos;d really like to get to know it better. You know, take it on a second date, then a third. I&apos;ll take it to the movies, the old-fashioned way ;) I&apos;ll wine it, dine it, maybe even take it on the obligatory weekend to Paris. It could be the beginning of a long lasting relationship. So, when is the DVD gonna be released ? ;) :)",

    "reviewBody": "&quot;These Amazing Shadows&quot; is a very inspiring film. You cannot watch it without feeling a strong sense of the importance of film preservation and film as an important part of our history. However, the film suffers from trying to do WAY too much in much to short a time. I could easily see several films or even a series come out of this material and felt the film just went way too fast.\n\nThe beginning of the film talks about the fragile nature of nitrate film stock (the standard for movies until the mid-1950s). You see how the film tends to stick together or turn to powder--though this is a bit rushed, as they never really talked about how combustible these old films are as well. And then you get to hear some film preservationists from the Library of Congress talk about their love of their work. I LOVED this part of the film and really wished they had just focused on this or perhaps done so a bit longer.\n\nThe next portion of the film is the biggest problem. A sampling of SOME of the films on the National Film Registry is given and folks say a few blurbs about them and what stands out about these films. Well, considering how important and great these films are, they certainly deserved MUCH more about why they were chosen and why they are so unique. It felt like someone trying to encapsulate the entire Bible or American History in 90 minutes or less! Overall, this is a nice introduction into film preservation and the National Registry, but better films on similar subjects have been made--ones that are more thorough and less episodic--such as &quot;Henri Langlois: The Phantom of the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que&quot;. Well worth seeing nevertheless.",

    "reviewBody": "I preferred last year&apos;s ceremony where the announcements of the nominations and the winners were declared without the fanfare. A year later after the Writers Strike, I was stunned to see the stars to be inebriated on stage. I would recommend that they don&apos;t serve liquor until after the awards are complete. In fact, Mickey Rourke&apos;s speech was memorable because he remembered to thank his dogs--his canine pets alive and gone. I think Kate Winslet&apos;s double win wasn&apos;t right but it&apos;s long overdue since she was nominated before. It&apos;s kind of sad that there are not enough good female roles around in the movies. I was really happy about Slumdog Millionaire winning all four awards including Best Drama. Still, I felt like the awards also forgot to remember those who passed away over the last two years. They omitted that to the television audience. I don&apos;t care what people wear but I think people should be better behaved at these events like staying sober. Tina Fey&apos;s wins are no surprise since her show is the only one that seems to get critics approval. There were funny moments in the show and they avoided showing clips. Steven Spielberg&apos;s moment receiving the Cecil B. DeMille Award was probably the best of the night. It was good to see John Adams, the mini-series based on David McCulloch&apos;s amazing book, to win awards for Best Mini-Series, Actor Paul Giamati, Actress Laura Linney, and Supporting Actor Tom Wilkinson OBE who played Ben Franklin. He wasn&apos;t there to pick up his Emmy so it was finally nice to see him there. I was surprised to see Dame Eileen Atkins CBE there who was nominated for Best Supporting Actress for Cranford. She didn&apos;t win the award. I was surprised and embarrassed by Ricky Gervais&apos; comment that &quot;if you do a Holocaust film, you get a GOlden Globe&quot; regarding Kate&apos;s first win of the evening. I was happy for Bruce Springsteen winning for &quot;The Wrestler.&quot; In the time where our economy is suffering at a depression status, films like &quot;The Wrestler&quot; and &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot; are recommendations to avoid seeing the silliness, over-indulgence, and millions of wasted dollars in the industry. Those two movies are character based and can relate to most of us out here who are trying to survive. I believe Spielberg&apos;s Cecil B. De Mille Award was from last year and I don&apos;t understand why they didn&apos;t award a recipient for this year. But if the actors want to strike, they can go ahead because I wouldn&apos;t mind losing the Oscars.",

The producers may think that he is good for the show by having his unorthodox opinions broadcast, but it is the opposite. Thousands and thousands of people refuse to watch it due to the fact Waly is even on it. The show would get a lot more viewers if it had a decent person on it... Better yet, get rid of the show completely and put something family friendly on. Too much TV is full of news, wars, sex and rubbish these days. No wonder the new generation are growing up as thugs. It is channel 9, channel 7, Channel 10&apos;s fault..."

The staging and set up is probably one of the best I&apos;ve seen in all my years of watching these shows. The pre-show done by Jackman and Anne Hathaway was passable, but the whole production came across as so real and human, it astounded us. This actually was very well done. The set up for the presentations were beautiful, reminiscent, reflective, and sweetly genuine. This moved us tremendously, and it helped us know how deep some of the relationships go inside Hollywood. This was most excellent, and I cannot wait until next year&apos;s show. I am already starting to wonder who will host, what movies will make it, and how the stage will be set up. Yeah, I&apos;mma geek.\n\nI have to say that Ben Stiller&apos;s parody of Joaquin Phoenix was the funniest moment in the show. I also loved Heath Ledger&apos;s family and what they had to say, promising and accepting Heath&apos;s posthumous Oscar to &quot;his sweet Mathilda.&quot; I loved the new way they set up and presented each Oscar. I loved the new &quot;tribute&quot; portion, Queen Latifah sang &quot;I&apos;ll be seeing you&quot; magnificently. I was moved by Jerry Lewis and the Academy&apos;s acknowledgment for all his hard work and dedication...coming out there on stage as he did, unaided by cane or friend (they&apos;re all gone now), seeing him standing there in sweet sweet reverie while his peers greet him with a &quot;standing O&quot; was so touching ... and so fitting.\n\nI won&apos;t bore you with who won what. Everyone else will do that. I just wanted to let you know what you missed, as this was the greatest Oscars show I can remember having seen. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I LOVE the changes they made to the presentation style. WOW! \n\nI give it 8/10 for great presentation and indefatigable style...\n\nthe Fiend :.",

For that alone, I give the show an 8. As I keep saying, award shows should be about the WINNERS, not about absurd musical numbers, witty repartee between ridiculously-paired presenters, any of that garbage; the WINNERS and their moment of glory onstage, accepting their awards, should be the main priority. \n\nDidn&apos;t like Jason Alexander&apos;s routine at the beginning where he calls his mother an &apos;imbece-ile&apos; for doing her own reviews of movies; that was really stupid, I thought. He could have done the same routine but set it up differently, without insulting his own mom. It&apos;s called a brain, Jason. Look into it. \n\nOf the winners, Anne Hathaway&apos;s speech was the most memorable - very moving and heartfelt. I also liked Richard Gere&apos;s acceptance of the Joel Siegel award; that was meaningful without sounding pompous, as Gere can sometimes come off.",

    "reviewBody": "This is a documentary, dealing with the likeliness of The Caped Crusader&apos;s gadgets existing in real life. It is admitted that several of the rather... theatrical and elaborate ones do, well, defy physical laws(the medium of graphic novels certainly has grown), however, quite a few are realistic, in the comics and the Chris Nolan films(the only ones of the silver screen releases of the overall franchise dealt with here... in case you didn&apos;t think that this was, at least to an extent, a promotional piece) alike. This consists of interviews, drawn material, movie clips, footage from behind the scenes as well as demonstrations of the technology, some of it even live-action(the rest is computer-generated). This is paced and edited well and doesn&apos;t overstay its welcome. The explanations are all nice, easy enough to understand and interesting, including how Kevlar works, and more specific ones, such as the grappling gun, fire-proof suit and the new vehicles. The experts all come off as perfectly credible, and the tone is kept a fitting mix of serious and excited throughout. It&apos;s undeniably a special experience to see a woman keep a straight face whilst using words that go something like &quot;we at the CIA&quot; and &quot;what Batman would use&quot; in the same sentence. I recommend this to anyone who wants to know about the equipment used by The Dark Knight. 8/10",

    "reviewBody": "This is 19 minute long, and is the sole documentary on the DVD of The Prestige. It consists of film clips, interviews with cast and crew, and behind the scenes footage.\n\nThe Director&apos;s Notebook is 3 and a half minutes long. It&apos;s about the meta aspect of how the movie talks about magic performances in ways that it&apos;s also about the picture&apos;s effect on people. That it used science to trick people. Spiritualism versus religion.\n\nConjuring The Past is 5 minutes long. They go into the visual design. Casting actors not common to period pieces to make it more contemporary. Costumes.\n\nThe Visual Maze is 3 and a half minutes long. Discussed is the way the filming is loose, with long takes, only the crew knowing who the camera is on, and how challenging that is.\n\nMetaphors of Deception is 3 and a half minutes long. In this as well as the novel it&apos;s based on, they used certain elements to engage and fool the audience.\n\nTesla: The Man Who Invented the Twentieth Century is 2 and a half minutes long. The man had to be a minor, though important, character, or he would be too big to cover in a single feature. In ways an underdog, many of his ideas were rejected, when today, he has been proved right. David Bowie(RIP) being the first and only choice for Nolan.\n\nResonances is 1 minute long. The director himself talks about what he hopes to achieve with the finished product. About the latter half of it is scrolling text that tells us important dates.\n\nI recommend this to anyone who wants to know more about the subject. 7/10",

This upsets me, because for the most part there is very little on telly for me worth watching, I just watch DVD&apos;s most of the time and for a long time one of the only highlights to an otherwise terrible week on telly, used to be Film. \n\nI cant help but think, there were so many other better choices for presenter of Film, Mark Kermode being a personal favourite, or Kim Newman, even James King who I hate more than third world poverty could do a better job. \n\nOh well looks like my only source of Film news and reviews now, besides the printed pages, are podcasts, at least BBC radio 5 live see fit to give me a brilliant movie review podcast every week, and so they should, since they&apos;ve destroyed Film",

    "reviewBody": "Film Noir: Bringing Darkness to Light (200) \n\n*** 1/2 (out of 4)\n\nInsightful and rather interesting look at the film noirs of the 40s and 50s. A wide range of producers, actors, writers, director and cinematographers are on hand to share their opinions of the genre. Such people include James Ellroy, Henry Rollins, Kim Newman, Syndey Pollack, Frank Miller, Eddie Miller, Glenn Erickson, Paul Schrader, Carol Littleton, Eric Lax, Christopher Nolan, Drew Casper, Talia Shire, Audrey Totter and Michael Madsen. The documentary is broken down into several different sections with each one taking a look at different subjects or styles. The thing that kicks off is what actually is a film noir. The various people give their opinions on what makes a noir and it should come as no shock that opinions are very different. From here we see what is considered the first film noir. Many say Fritz Lang&apos;s M was the first noir with others pointing to STRANGERS ON THE 3RD FLOOR. Some even go back to the crime pictures of the 1930s like LITTLE CAESAR. From here we go through various topics like the impact WWII had on the genre, the importance of cigarettes in terms of a visual as well as sexuality and we talk about the lighting and how flashbacks were used. If you&apos;re a fan of the genre then you&apos;re going to have a good time hearing all these stories and different opinions. For the most part just about everything you&apos;d want to know is covered but it&apos;s mostly the MGM/Warner/RKO noirs that are discussed. The film goes through many different topics and never feels too long. Titles discussed include BORN TO KILL, CLASH BY NIGHT, THE NARROW MARGIN, CRIME WAVE, ON DANGEROUS GROUND, HIS KIND OF WOMAN, OUT OF THE PAST, THE MALTESE FALCON, MURDER MY SWEET, THEY LIVE BY NIGHT and several others. Film critic Newman even talks about those Val Lewton horror movies from RKO and why they should be considered noir. Overall, this is a very impressive look at the genre and if you&apos;re unfamiliar with the films then it gives you a great number of titles to check out."

    "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve been fortunate to have spent some time living in the South and getting to know southerners, including many in Charlie Rose&apos; home state of North Carolina. The South is a singular region and contributes significantly to the American mosaic. I&apos;m not talking about the `Big South&apos;; Atlanta, Charlotte, etc. but the South of small to mid-sized towns where traces of authentic regionality still remain. Once you get past the almost inescapable, low-grade xenophobia that southerners often exhibit, they can be amazingly good-natured and generous. People everywhere have this capacity, of course, but southerners have a certain, unique way of doing it, a certain style. They also can, if one steps over lines that are often invisible to all except the natives, be quite judgmental and unforgiving. But again, it&apos;s all done with that certain style. Because I appreciate southerners, I appreciate Charlie Rose who is nothing if not southern. A product of the granitic Americana that still lives below the Mason-Dixon, and further polished by matriculation at Duke, the Stanford of the East, or Yale of the South, whichever works for you, Charlie Rose has enough suave for an entire ballroom of people and is slicker than snot on a glass doorknob.\n\nThis is one reason why his show works so well. Another is that Mr. Rose is a lawyer by training (Duke Law, of course), and he does not interview guests as much as cross-examines them. But he does it with such riveting savoir faire that his guests seldom know what has hit them; no need for anyone to be under oath. We are reminded that it&apos;s not what one does so much as how one does it; an understanding that must absolutely be grasped for successful navigation of the bayous of southern society. Rose&apos;s interviews of relevant figures in diplomatic and political circles, as well as his timely foci on other critical current affairs are often real public services, more than worthy of our time and attention. In the days following 9/11, there was seldom a better place to be on the tube than the Charlie Show. Mr. Rose has certainly paid his dues and established his well-deserved niche. But why is he such an unabashed Celebrity Hag?\n\nWatching Charlie Rose fawn over someone like, for example, Tom Cruise, actually seeming to care what he thinks, is highly embarrassing. Sure Mr. Cruise is a competent actor. I admire his integrity and lack of obvious vanity in such films as Born On The Fourth Of July. Hell, I didn&apos;t even mind him in Legend. But let&apos;s keep it real. There&apos;s something about getting paid cyclopean amounts of money that tends to bring out the best in many of us. I certainly appreciate film, but if I find myself even slightly concerned about the details of Tom Cruise&apos;s thought process, or that of almost any actor, so many of whom are remarkably uninteresting `in person&apos;, I&apos;ll know that I no longer have a life. I mean, do Julianne Moore or Nicole Kidman, both undeniably luminous, really have anything to tell us, especially now? Tom Hanks? For the entire hour? (If only Charlie and I were both black so I could say, `N****r, please.&apos; )  Sure, Tom&apos;s a nice guy, but so am I, despite my lack of millions, and I have had more than a few reasons not to keep the nice going.\n\nWe, and Charlie, genuflect to such people because we are becoming a society of actors; unauthentic, psychologically-truncated role players and poseurs. We just don&apos;t get paid big bucks for it; the dubious index by which we almost all measure our worth. We want to be someone else but without ever having discovered our true selves. Charlie Rose may not quite understand this, but he definitely knows how to use it. Sorry, Charlie, but when I see a Hollywood mug at the oak table, I&apos;m gone, especially when said mug belongs to the astonishingly successful Michael Crichton, the person whom, I suspect, Charlie himself really wants to be. Crichton, ever gracious, as someone with his cash reserves can be, seems almost embarrassed at times by Charlie&apos;s slightly goggled-eyed supplication. You&apos;re cool too, C.R. Trust me. We all are, if you know how to see it. But, when the dust settles, I&apos;ll keep my Confederate money on you, Charlie, even if Benjamin Netanyahu rather snoidily rejected your offer to bear diplomatic communications to Hosni Mubarak. (Hey, Bibi&apos;s on the bench. You&apos;re still out there, plus you had to leave something for him to do, right?) You&apos;re still ok, even when your impatience at not being allowed to define international policy on the air nearly gets the better of you. Thanks for the many good moments. Keep up the good work."

On their list of Best Musicals, &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; was (to my knowledge) not even featured, &quot;Singin&apos; in the Rain&quot; was about #13 and in the top 10 was &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The TV Musical.&quot;\n\nIt&apos;s almost laughable.\n\nIt&apos;s the equivalent of people having voted &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; as the greatest film of all time on IMDb - in my opinion many of these people (similar to those who voted for Will Smith as the greatest actor of all time) just don&apos;t know much and are relying on their very brief knowledge of film history to form an answer. Most people I talk about movies to truly don&apos;t have any interest in anything predating the &apos;90s, they&apos;re always raving about the newest crappy blockbuster that I&apos;ve heard (via IMDb, of all places!) is trash. \n\nBut why should I take it so seriously - these are the same people who voted Gen-X actors into the list. I half expected to see Josh Hartnett pop up or something."

Brief, it touches upon a lot of topics, many of them only for a very short time. Everyone has something to add, and comes across as understanding the material.\n\nThey go into remaking the original. It starting as a whodunit which becomes a how- and why-dunit. Being Hitchcockian. His biological clock being messed up by the lack of nights. The ever-present light, things going on in the background. Conveying being tired without that rubbing off on the audience. How subjective the story is. Putting the viewer inside his head. Meeting Al for the first time. How he gives to who he works with. Casting Robin(RIP) against type. His choice not to go for a Peter Lorre, as it would have had to be consistent throughout. The psychological game between Will and Walter. Using the normal for creepy. Shades of grey. Following a man&apos;s conscience as his mind deteriorates through stress factors. Making disturbing features.\n\nI recommend this to anyone who wants to know more about the picture. 7/10",

    "reviewBody": "This is found on my library&apos;s copy of Insomnia. It&apos;s an 17 minute interview with Christopher Nolan and Al Pacino. As it announces itself, it is: An unscripted conversation on a Saturday afternoon. Sipping tea, which is an... interesting sight, for both, perhaps especially the latter, who is calm as a breeze, in person and out of character. A lot of what is discussed isn&apos;t specific to this movie, rather, both talk craft, based on their experiences with other professionals in the business.\n\nThey go into trusting the work they are doing. Theatre versus cinema. Francis Ford Coppola, and his reaction to not getting an extra setup on a funeral scene(as you may know, there are a few of those in the Godfather trilogy). Rehearsal, talking through, story-boarding and the comparisons between those approaches. The relationships between cast and crew. Using your time right. Sidney Lumet would ask a lot, and it would pay off: Serpico is used as an example, and I would have to agree that you can see the effort put into it. Using an old-fashioned lens and distance between actor and camera. Projecting, not screaming, on stage. Trusting the face to express what they&apos;re thinking, on the silver screen. Tony Montana being Cuban. How Walter is played and what effect that has. What it adds to watch it more than once. The odd couple dynamic.\n\nI recommend this to anyone who wants to know more about the picture. 7/10",

These two movie critics who worked for rival newspapers in Chicago (Siskel worked at the Tribune, and Ebert work for the Sun-Times) were put together to see if they could work together. Indeed they worked very well.  So well they had to switch producers/distributors TWICE, and by the time they did they show for Disney their &quot;Two Thumbs Up&quot; became the standard in movie industry.\n\nNow Richard Roeper has taken on Gene Siskel role, with the power of the &quot;Thumb&quot; along with it.  Roeper is not Siskel and nor should he be.  Unlike Siskel, Roeper also works at the Sun-Times along with Ebert, and because of this someone might ask can Roeper think for himself?  Indeed Roeper can and quite frequently these two critics can give a split vote on movies.  Roeper also gives the audience that is someone younger to interact with an elder critic.  Roeper was in his teens when Siskel and Ebert started their TV friendship\n\nThe show itself is done at a faster pace and their Thumb up/down is shown during the review as well as at recap of the show.  The set is now a hybrid of an average TV Set and a Movie theater balcony.  Who would put video monitors in the back of a movie theater anyway LOL.\n\nEbert and Roeper will never be a `Siskel &amp; Ebert&apos; but it does show the movie review program still has some gas in the tank left.  How much?  I don&apos;t know, just enjoy the ride.  Even I think their are both nuts at times.  Most movie critics are."

    "reviewBody": "I have always enjoyed watching celebrity documentaries like &quot;E! True Hollywood Story&quot; and &quot;Biography.&quot; When I saw the documentary series, &quot;Too Young to Die&quot; on Netflix, I just knew I had to add it to my list. \n\nSo far, I have watched the following episodes from Season 1: &quot;Sharon Tate,&quot; &quot;Natalie Wood,&quot; &quot;Judy Garland,&quot; &quot;Kurt Cobain,&quot; and &quot;River Phoenix.&quot; \n\nThis documentary series definitely does not disappoint the viewer. Each episode is narrated well and we get a glimpse into each celebrity&apos;s life. Each episode covers the star&apos;s life from when he or she was born until his or her final days. We also get to see where they grew up and learn more about their childhood and rise to stardom. Also each episode has a running time of 51 minutes which I think is a good length. I think it isn&apos;t too long but isn&apos;t too short either. \n\nWe get to hear perspectives and insights from family members, friends, colleagues, biographers, fellow fans, and so forth. These tiny details are often not something we can find in books or movies. But these things can only be told by those who were very close to the celebrities themselves. \n\nAlso this series really makes you think of what could have been if he or she had lived. What else would they have been able to achieve? What other dreams did they hope to fulfill? Why did fate get in the way of their aspiring success? \n\nSome of these celebrities were just starting out and were on their way to achieving astounding possibilities but their lives were tragically cut short. Some reached high levels of fame and popularity but didn&apos;t know how to handle it all. It just became too much for them. Then there were some who came crashing down because they weren&apos;t getting many job offers like they used to. They felt their days were outnumbered. \n\nAll these people lived for such a short while but made such an impression on pop culture and left behind such legacies. Fortunately, we have their movies, music, and stories to remember them by.\n\nOn a side note, I would have to disagree with what another reviewer had posted on here regarding some celebrities being too &quot;old&quot; when they died. I know some celebrities died in their 20s which is very young while others have died in their 40s. If we compare that to how most people in general pass away in their 70s+ then I think the 40s age range is still pretty young. However, I do agree with what the reviewer said regarding this series being well presented and including thorough research. \n\nI hope there will be a season 2 because I am looking forward to watching it. I would like to see episodes in season 2 or future seasons which feature James Dean (24), Dominique Dunne (22), Rebecca Schaeffer (21), Karen Carpenter (32), and Jonathan Brandis (27). \n\nIf you like documentaries like &quot;E! True Hollywood Story&quot; or any other celebrity documentary series then I highly recommend &quot;Too Young to Die.&quot; You won&apos;t be disappointed!",

    "reviewBody": "I for one have always been a big fan of comics especially the brand made by DC, my favorite is &quot;Batman&quot;. And after watching this documentary &quot;Secret Origin: The Story of DC Comics&quot; one can respect and enjoy the companies start and history even more. As you see with the times and as each decade past DC changed the content of it&apos;s comics to fit the times more in a social, political, and demographic manner. The comics would become more dark and they would begin to have a graphic edge to them.\n\nFrom the start as you watch this educational and informative film you will see how DC created the Super hero, using many of the early stories to fit the times of war and depression. Then you see how DC tied in with Warner Bros, and this would lead to broader appeals for Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman in the form of radio, TV, and big screen movies. As with each decade passed DC would shake things up changing stories in each comic to meet the ever changing times. The stories were more outspoken taking on political corruption as it was almost like that super heroes had to fight leaders and authority figures. Thru the 75 year history this lead to more writers and artist with an edge as they produced more modern and serious graphic novels.\n\nAs shown in the film comic books, and super heroes give us hope they are our dreams and escape from an ordinary way of life, as you feel that way and you even get that take during the film with interviews from well known historians, comic book inventors, and the film shows how comics and DC even though challenged impacted society, yet it&apos;s staying power is proved with TV, film and merchandise. Overall near excellent film that&apos;s informative and educational as you learn some stuff about DC that you may not have known. A must see for any comic book buff and history lover.",
