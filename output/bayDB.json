Infected Americans are ripped from their homes and forced into quarantine camps known as Q-Zones, from which there is no escape, as a few brave souls fight back against the forces of oppression. Amid this dystopian landscape, a fearless courier, Nico (KJ Apa), who&apos;s immune to the deadly pathogen, finds hope and love with Sara (Sofia Carson), though her lockdown prohibits them from physical contact. When Sara is believed to have become infected, Nico races desperately across the barren streets of Los Angeles in search of the only thing that can save her from imprisonment ... or worse."

I liked the fact that they focus on several people&apos;s lives and thus, several aspects of this apocalyptic word. This gives an overview of what the creators of the movie imagined the world could look like. I agree that some parts of the script are kinda dumb, but overall I believe it deserves more than its imdb score and most of the reviews here.",

    "reviewBody": "Best cinema experience I&apos;ve had in a while. A near full house with a near silent crowd (some loud eaters heh). Some may not of enjoyed the lack of plot (as in not much happens) and the ending, but I just see this film as a continuation of the story (as it&apos;s obvious there will be a third). You have to remember that it&apos;s right after the ending of the first one so the setting and time is the exact same, I think some people didn&apos;t get that. Millicent Simmonds shines in this film and Cillian Murphy alongside her only makes it better. Emily Blunt is still great but steps down this time and let&apos;s Millicent take the spotlight and she uses it perfectly. I didn&apos;t find the sequel as scary as the first film, but the scenes that had some jump scares in them were executed very well. Replacing the lack of scares in this film are big action pieces, which are great on the big screen, but I would of preferred more silent scenes where sound is used as a jump scare element rather than big explosions and loud sounds, but the action was still intense. Again, the sound design is perfect, especially when we&apos;re through Regans perspective and sound is cut out completely. Favourite scene was definitely the opening, big action scenes and a good origin to how the world is how it is. The only thing that bugged me was the theme of family has died down. It&apos;s now become &apos;every man for himself&apos; almost, but we get a few moments that revolve around the theme of family, but you can see Regan and Marcus trying to be like their father during the film and trying to lead the family to safety. Highly recommend seeing this film, even if horror is not your taste you can appreciate the sound and production design.",

It wasn&apos;t long and the concept and story IMO were great! Not to mention the theater experience with everyone screaming,clapping and laughing helped immensely.

    "reviewBody": "Honestly I skiped watching this film when it came out because after Revenge of the Fallen i lost interest in any Transformers related media. This not only took me by suprise, when i watched it during lockdown, but also weirdly became not only my favorite TF movie, but also one of my top 5 movies of all time!\n\nThe movie is more focused on character work than plot (like Alita battle Angel and Shazam for example) yet it worked. Bumblebee and Charlies relationship was so much fun to watch grow and actually made me cry during some scenes of the movie. They are the heart and soul of the movie which made it more rewatcable. It also makes sense since Bee in every other version of TF is suposed to be the human side of Autobots, caring and more friendly, and always had a human side-character next to him, which makes sense to ad Charlie as support to him. This also brings down a negative because most people may not be that interested in a Mean Girls type story with &quot;finding your place in the world&quot; theme, with some quiet and more lighthearted moments not excpected from this type of movie.\n\nNow for the script, it feels like an actual 80s friendship movie (Karate Kid, The Iron Giant, Free Willy), chessy, funny, emotinal and overall easy to follow. It might be boring to some people, but it worked for me.\n\nThere was a scene similar to the 2007 movie, which was in the trailer, where he trashes the house which later links to the story going foward, which was cute and funny, but it kind of ruined the more emotinal parts which i adored and loved with the goofynes, and thats the only scene i kind of didn&apos;t liked.\n\nThe casting of the movie was very good in my opinion, with Hailee Steinfeld shining as Charlie, and John Cena actually being not that bad as Agent Burns as i excpected him to be. I also have not found any other character to be anoying, and Dylan O&apos; Bryan was perfect as Bumblebee and i want his voice back for the sequel. Decepticions were great and well realyzed. More positivity, the action sequences were pretty great, the 80s vibe of the movie with his Best of soundtrack and overall story was enjoyable and designs were great and in my opinion better than in Miachel Bays films.\n\nThe movie may not be enjoyed by people who liked the previous films or don&apos;t want another 80s growing of age story, and maybe because of the design changes, focus on character and the movie not having a clear plot like in most action/adventure movies, but that is on you to decide. The movie is more about friendship and overcoming your problems and finding someone who can understands, cares and listens to you and helps you move foward as a person.\n\nOverall, this was a breath of freshair for me and a big number of people who were fans of the franchise but not invested in the mostly bad Bay films, (I loved the first one) with great action, characters, soundtrack , G1 cybertron with full on fan base material and visuals that made it a pleasure to watch, witch gives it a special place in my heart.\n\nDefinitely recommend you see it and form your opinion. 8/10 for me",

No one was able to be viewed as a &quot;good guy&quot; because, given the right circumstances, we all harbor terrible passions that can be let out if allowed. In this movie, they show &quot;how it all started&quot; but in doing so, they couldnt help but pander to a certain group of people who want to make all white people evil and all black and poor people victims. Even the black gangsters who routinely kill and spread evil over the world end up being shown as &quot;true heroes&quot;. Why does everything have to be &quot;this group is good, this group is bad&quot;? There are good and bad in ALL groups and that is what made Purge so awesome. I doubt I will watch any more of these films. Trust Hollywood elite to ruin a good thing because they cant keep their opinions to themselves.",

    "reviewBody": "A Quiet Place follows a single family as they navigate a new world of silence. The daughter of the family being deaf gives them an advantage in this landscape as they&apos;re all still able to communicate with one another. But this movie isn&apos;t about the alien invasion, it&apos;s about them, the family. It&apos;s about being a family. The mother, Evelyn is heavily pregnant, which as you can imagine poses its own problems. You can&apos;t keep babies quiet, and good luck not screaming through labour. Thankfully they&apos;re a smart family with a lot of smart solutions to problems. For instance they have a soundproofed basement for the baby to reside in, and a further soundproofed box with breathing apparatus to put the child in should things get hairy. They use a system of lights as a warning, use paths of sand to walk around barefoot, and keep connections with other local survivors by regular check-ins by firelight.\n\nWhat I found really refreshing and unexpected about this movie was how incredibly light it was on plot. Where did the creatures come from? Doesn&apos;t matter. How have the family managed to keep corn crops without making a sound? Doesn&apos;t matter. Why is the mother pregnant again? Doesn&apos;t really matter, but you&apos;ll understand if you pay attention and don&apos;t lack brain cells. Instead the film is super simple, basing almost the entirety of the action on the family farm, and almost all the tension derives from things going from bad to worse one thing at a time, and setting it all up well in advance. You see the nail pointing up through the step and you know what&apos;s going to happen. Rather than this predictability being a problem, it instead suspends you as you wait for the inevitable, and fully understand the consequences of when it does finally happen. And then it snowballs. One thing after another, and even when you think they&apos;re safe, something else happens putting your heart back in your throat.\n\nThe acting is great all round, especially from the kid actors. John Krasinski achieves a perfect balance between acting and directing, giving a very genuine performance as a father stuck in a hard position, trying his best to protect his family. Near the end his performance may even give you chills. Emily Blunt is fantastic as the mother, going through the emotions effortlessly as if this was all really happening. She&apos;s a supportive mother, a loving wife, and when she endures pain, she endures it harder than anyone else. Naturally the chemistry Blunt and Krasinski share is palpable, which is not surprising considering their real life relationship. But the kids really impress. Noah Jupe is maybe the most expected of the child actors as Marcus, who still clings to being a child as much as he can despite knowing he needs to mature up and help pull his weight. He&apos;s ultimately a child wracked by fear. Millicent Simmonds absolutely nails it though as the defiant Regan, determined to not be defined or looked down upon by her disability. Her real life deafness really adds authenticity to the emotions she displays, having grown up with other ways to communicate and emote. Big props to everyone else for learning sign language though, the movie wouldn&apos;t have been the same without it.\n\nAnd yet the biggest star of the movie was the sound department, or more rather their restraint. The film&apos;s biggest strength is its use of silence. Every little sound becomes amplified and carries so much more weight than usual, thanks in large part to so much of the movie being in absolute silence. The score by Marco Beltrami never betrays this approach, only peeking in when absolutely necessary to add emotional depth and enhance the suspense. Krasinski otherwise lets the silence speak for itself. There&apos;s nothing more nerve-wracking than a rattle, bang, or cry when it literally means life or death.\n\nA Quiet Place is a tight ninety minutes of nail-biting tension. It never outstays its welcome, touches on just enough world-building to entice without detracting from the core family and their one bad night in the country, and displays some of the most restrained and atmospheric directing from Krasinski. There are plot holes here, but they never detract from the film&apos;s underlying foundations, and most can be explained away with a little bit of thought, or just simply don&apos;t matter to the story it wants to tell. Why didn&apos;t she remove the nail? I don&apos;t know, when did she even have a chance to remove the nail? I give A Quiet Place a very high 8/10, and honestly I could easily give it more.",

If the review mentions &apos;web sleuths&apos; they are probably talking about the Netflix doc. This one doesn&apos;t have any &apos;web sleuths&apos;.\n\nAs for this documentary: The first episode was good but it went a little off the rails after that. We start in the.80s-90s with the episode about Richard Ramirez and Jack Unterweger. This one was kind of interesting.\n\nThen the second episode jumps to 2013 with the Elisa Lam case. This episode can&apos;t decide if it want&apos;s to be straight true crime or spooky supernatural. It kind of hints at the later (see below) but then again not really. They should have either gone there nor not, not half way in between.\n\nThe third episode was the weakest, jumping back to the 60s. The timeline was confusing. Especially if you notice that the dialogue of couple fighting was the same dialogue of a couple fighting that Elisa Lam heard in her room right before someone knocked on her door and she opened it to find nobody there. (Were they trying to hint that she was hearing ghosts or just being cheap and reusing the sound bite?) There didn&apos;t seem to be enough of a story for the third episode so they randomly branched off into the Black Dahlia case. It took me about 5 minutes of internet searching to discover that the ties between the Black Dahlia and the Cecil Hotel are tenuous to non-existent so its inclusion makes no sense.",

Probably one of the best seasons of a TV show out there and it was all due to the character development from the first season.\n\nDuring season 2 I found myself consistently updating my rating of this show. I initially had it scored a 6 out of 10. Now have it a solid 9. I can&apos;t wait for the next season. \n\nIf you are planing to watch this show. Stick with it through some of the long drawn out scenes in season 1 and you will be rewarded immensely.\n\nThis is defiantly another winner for starz",

    "reviewBody": "If you first &quot;Ouija&quot; film, you might have been inclined to skip this addition (a prequel) to the series. No one would blame you. &quot;Ouija&quot; is a laughably awful film. &quot;Ouija: Origin of Evil&quot; however, is a surprisingly competent and thoroughly enjoyable horror movie.\n\nPerhaps it should not come as a surprise that &quot;O of E&quot; turned out so well. With the steady guidance of director Mike Flanagan (Hush, Oculus, Haunting of Hill House), one of the most consistent creators of scary stories in the business, we should expect high quality work. Once again, he delivers.\n\nThe story revolves around a recently widowed mother and her two daughters. At risk of losing their old, creepy and possibly haunted (definitely haunted) house, the mother resorts to work as a fake medium to make money, calling on her daughters to contribute to the ruse. Things get more exciting when the mother brings home a Ouija board, not knowing that sinister spirits would soon possess her younger daughter.\n\nThen, as we witness the little girl&apos;s behavior grow increasingly strange, our goosebumps grow increasingly prevalent (because creepy little girls are a reliably freaky scary movie trope). The older sister soon suspects something, the little girl crawls on walls, and a priest shows up to help. That stuff is predictable and somewhat unoriginal. But this movie still works because of its splendid acting - the little girl, Doris (Lulu Wilson), is particularly impressive - and deft direction.\n\nMike Flanagan clearly knows how to run the show. He makes sure that &quot;O of E&quot; becomes a far cry from other horror movies of this ilk, which possess so little inventiveness in their direction.\n\nWith this film, we are treated to elegant camera movement, unnerving closeups, and evocative framing and angle choices that all appear purposeful and thought through. Instead of calling attention to an evil presence on screen with a hard cut, we simply see a shadowy figure crouching on the edge of the frame.\n\nFlanagan also chooses to include limited jump scares and, mercifully, no fake jump scares. Fake jump scares are what I call those moments of building tension when the sound goes silent, then suddenly there&apos;s a blast of jarring noise that makes us jump out of our seats as the camera reveals a harmless friend character. It&apos;s a cheap manipulation, a dirty trick. We deserve better, and Flanagan gives us better.\n\nRather than turning to a loud and bombastic score to sell scares, Flanagan relies on the editing and our natural inclinations as viewers to feel scared. He trusts that when something scary that unexpectedly appears in front of us on screen, it will deliver chills.\n\n&quot;O of E&quot; delivers a slow-building eerie viewing experience. There are no excessive bursts of violence. Nothing is over-the-top. It&apos;s a small-scale movie, but one that is nonetheless effective. I recommend it to any fans of possession movies, especially if you prefer ones devoid of gore.",

This feels like a good conclusion to the Purge series, with the upcoming first Purge explaining how it all started. This one had a story as well as the usual tales of hate and revenge. This was visually very good, some of the scenes looked great, the shop under attack scenes in particular was expertly staged. It was well acted once again, and the story was rather intriguing. It lacked some of the subtleties of the first film, and at times it did feel like we&apos;ve been here before many times, but overall it was very watchable, I got the impression all involved were taking it very seriously. 7/10",

Unlike the first Ninja Turtle movie, which was considered one of the worst films of the year. \n\n2 years after the Ninja Turtles stopped Shredder&apos;s attack on New York City Shredder escapes his prison transport. With the help of Bebop and Rock Steady Shredder gets ready for the arrival of the alien brain Krang, The Ninja Turtles have to step &quot;out of the shadows&quot; to save New York again with help from Cassey Jones. \n\nThis is what good fan service looks like. The characters look and act like there suppose to, especially Bebop and Rock Steady. It is amazing that they made them look like they did in the cartoon as oppose to a more gritty and realistic like the transformers. The story is a fun not to serious ride, that feels like a marvel movie as oppose to a Dark Knight. The acting of course isn&apos;t anything to write home about, and I&apos;m starting to wonder if Will Arnett owes someone money. Seriously he seems to be in everything now. I can&apos;t recommend this movie enough but, a word of warning if you were never a fan of the ninja turtles. This probably isn&apos;t the dumb fun summer blockbuster for you. \n\nFor more great reviews go to the distractionattack.com",

I have decades of experience wreck diving and I have to say that the methods being used to dive the wreck are not good. If they were serious they would use saturation dives and mechanical grabs to dismantle the wreck. They should be using re-breathers or other self contained equipment so that the divers may swim freely. An observation chamber to direct operations as used on the famous salvage of gold from the Niagra would be another option. The umbilical cables are very cumbersome and don&apos;t do the job efficiently.\n\nThe wreck itself is collapsed and and cannot be entered, say, as the Andrea Doria. I think that along with natural decay it was also depth charged during WWII. There is also no solid evidence that the gold exists.\n\nI do wish them luck, however.",

Adding a third conflict with another Arab state would have over extended US armed forces resources to one region, complicating a difficult situation already happening. I am glad most of those PMC&apos;s made it home alive to their families and did exactly what their contract states, solved the situation by themselves. Great movie ,but brought up horrible memories for me. With the facts I presented keep those facts in mind when sitting down to watch this movie or watch it again.

There were a couple of plot holes but there were also some funny nods to movies such as Back to the Future which I enjoyed. You remember the scene where Doc Brown is trying to get two electric cables to connect?\n\nIt reminded me a lot of the superb low-budget &apos;Primer&apos; which covers some of the same ground. In that movie, some geekie guys accidentally discover time-travel and have to decide what to do with it. Also, Almanac had some good jokes, which many movies seem to leave out.\n\nSeriously, did you see any jokes in Man of Steel? Sadly the shocking camera work ruined the whole experience.All the jumping about, whirling, juddering and flicking etc. It just made me feel ill.",

    "name": "A Bad Movie, Not Just a Bad Turtles Movie",
    "reviewBody": "Folks, it&apos;s no exaggeration when I say this one is bad. And I&apos;m not just reviewing it as a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie. The Ninja Turtles are a lore. Every telling of the story deserves its own version, like Dracula, Sherlock Holmes, or Batman. Adam West, Michael Keaton, Christian Bale, and Ben Affleck all play different versions of Batman in different universes. Though I have a version of the Turtles I like best, I can set aside that prejudice for this review. It&apos;s just a very awful film. It&apos;s so bad, I don&apos;t understand how the current rating stands at 6 stars.\n\nThe movie has no real sense of identity, like the filmmakers really had no idea what to do with it. Where are the Turtles going to go? What are they going to do when they get there? Is it going to be spring time or winter? Should it be in the city or in the mountains? Low to the ground in dark settings or high up on roof tops in broad daylight? Are the Turtles stealthy ninjas or mini-Hulks that just needlessly destroy stuff? And are they main characters or secondary plot pieces? Is April O&apos;Neil tech savvy, or does she still conduct interviews with pen and paper? (Through the first half-hour, perhaps even by the end of the film, you&apos;ll have a tough time convincing yourself the title shouldn&apos;t have been &quot;April O&apos;Neil: The Movie.&quot;)\n\nIt&apos;s very evident that the writers did not know how to work with &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.&quot; Again, this has nothing to do with a faithfulness to any kind of version of TMNT. Just, really, they had no clue how to make those four elements work. They&apos;re not so much teenagers as they are just dumb. The movie lets the Turtles aspect be self-implied. The Mutants part as well, though it does play loosely into the plot (heh, just kidding, there is no plot). The idea of ninjutsu, though, is a complete afterthought. Seriously, it&apos;s just sandwiched in there somewhere and plays no relevance to the story whatsoever, nor has an identifying presence for any character, even Splinter or Shredder.\n\nYeah, Shredder. That&apos;s a whole other useless incorporation. The guy is somewhere between a clunky Power Ranger villain (the ones in great big suits that don&apos;t move very well) and Bane from &quot;Batman and Robin.&quot; He doesn&apos;t even fill the main villain role. That &quot;honor&quot; would go to William Fichtner&apos;s character, Eric sounds-like-sex Sacks. Shredder&apos;s just a tool. His appearance, fighting-style, and overall awkwardness are all loud, awful reminders of how the filmmakers knew nothing about ninjutsu or how to use it. &quot;You know what? Just make &apos;em fight with ninja weapons, put lots and lots of blades around, and be sure the word &apos;Japan&apos; gets into someone&apos;s origin story somewhere. Close enough.&quot;\n\nYes, the Turtles are kind of funny, but it&apos;s completely incidental. There were times when the movie tried to force something humorous, but in the theater I was in, no one laughed. And I was in a packed house. Their personalities are nothing but typecasting: Leo is the serious control-freak, Raphael the brooding B.A., Michelangelo is a goof-ball, and Donatello is the inventive... nerd! Yeah, nerds are inventive, right? Let&apos;s make him a snorting, glasses-wearing dork! You know what, just make him Simon from Alvin and the Chipmunks. You never feel like you get to be a part of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. They&apos;re just kind of there. The viewer is more watching from April or Vern&apos;s vantage point, never fully involved in the brotherhood.\n\nThere&apos;s a whole lot more stupid that goes on for the sake of convenience: like Donatello&apos;s bo able to flip over an SUV, or the fact that an iron construction beam can&apos;t support the weight of Leo and Donnie, but Raph who comes to their rescue can (what, are they as heavy as semi-trucks?). Watch out for the abundance of product-placement. This is a Michael Bay produced film, remember. At one point, Splinter pretty much monologues a Pizza Hut ad.\n\nIn closing, I want to leave you with this, because until we get this, these horrible, ridiculous movies will continue to get made. In an interview with an MTV whoever, TMNT producer Michael Bay said that he doesn&apos;t care if people think his movies are bad. Speaking specifically about the latest Transformers installation, &quot;They love to hate, and I don&apos;t care. Let them hate. They&apos;re still going to see the movie!&quot;\n\nThis movie is a poo-pile of a film. I&apos;m intentionally avoiding the usual puns like &quot;it was a shell-acking&quot; or &quot;I left the theater shell-shocked&quot; because, again, my affinity for the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles has nothing to do with how bad this movie is. As long as we keep paying to see what we know is going to be a bad movie, they&apos;ll keep getting made. And it doesn&apos;t matter that they&apos;re bad, because we&apos;ll pay for it no matter how bad it is.\n\nOr maybe these movies keep getting manufactured because there is actually a niche of people who like them. After all, it has a rating of 6 out of 10 stars...",

The Purge:Anarchy rights the wrongs of its predecessor and delivers on the high concept. The characters are thinly written, but played with adequate skill by the actors and a more than decent performance by Frank Grillo as the lead. The satire is about as subtle as a round of bullets to the chest and the film never feels comfortable during the few moments the story calms down to spend time developing the characters, but this was made for visceral thrills and B grade enjoyment. The mayhem is relentless and while the low budget certainly reduced the amount of arson to a few fleeting glimpses, the violent set pieces are staged with enough wit to make this sequel a nice surprise.",

Wahlberg is always fun to watch and the main chick is cute but the last 1.5 hours is straight action and no plot and I wanted to walk out before I had a seizure.\n\nSpecial effects were visually pleasing, but would have been better if I cared what was going on. Don&apos;t get me wrong, I&apos;m not a hater. I tried so hard to be interested in this flick but I found myself looking at my watch obsessively for the last hour.\n\nOn the lighter side, the idea behind the plot was interesting and though provoking but poorly executed on screen.\n\nI have never written a review before, but this movie was so utterly disappointing that I felt obligated to warn humanity. We are truly living in the age of extinction when we allow a piece of garbage like this to pass as a major motion picture release in the 21st century.",

    "reviewBody": "I wasn&apos;t thrilled with the movie, but that doesn&apos;t mean it was not good. Actually, I think this film had incredible substance, due particularly in part to the casting. I would have given it 7 stars, but the length of the film took it down a notch (they could have knocked off 14-19 minutes worth of unnecessary, and sometimes boring footage).\n\nThe film started off with Wahlberg seeming to be just like Wahlberg. But, long story short, he and the film evolved to a character that fit him (and vice versa). Based upon the plot, I think it was a good match.\n\nDwayne Johnson is not brand new to drama, but this was a different kind of role nonetheless. I don&apos;t feel he was 100% there, but his likable character makes you just ignore it. I think with a few more roles like this, he&apos;ll be better.\n\nI&apos;m not that familiar with Mackie, but he did a great job in his role. Apart from Shalhoub, he was probably one of the most believable characters. He made me think of a subdued and more serious version of Mike Epps.\n\nShalhoub....well, what can you say about this guy? He was awesome in Monk, and his style is always great. He is a talented actor and the casting of him was a solid choice. He has that goof look to him, yet his face can show some noteworthy seriousness. This was no Giamatti being cast as a thug...Shalhoub can pull off a &quot;tough guy&quot; pretty well.\n\nI&apos;ve always been fond of Ed Harris, but his role was insignificant. Same for Corddry.\n\nAll in all, this was a well-made film deserving to be watched. I doubt I would ever watch it again due to it&apos;s slow development at times, but I&apos;m glad I did see it. The casting was unexpected and unique.",

Yeah people don&apos;t like his movies (me included) but they are sort of entertaining especially when seen on a big screen in theaters. Some of his films are even pretty good (The Rock (1996) for example). But, to get to the point, this man is very creative. He always try to make new things to impress the audience. He is also a real hard worker. The work, he and his crew did to bring us this movie was phenomenal and he deserves to be respected for that. This documentary, for me, is actually better than the movie itself. I&apos;ve always loved to watch behind the scenes of films, but this one is pretty well made and detailed. And it&apos;s very inspirational for aspiring filmmakers such as myself. So bravo for the job Bay and his crew did. Keep &apos;em comin.",

    "reviewBody": "Well, lets get a quick look at the film. Explosions, CGI, 3D and after these comes everything else. These three things are the main reason why one should watch Transformers: Dark of the Moon. We all know who Mr. Bay is and what his movies are famous for: explosions, explosions, explosions and destruction, destruction, destruction. Plot has never been his strongest feature, but hey, and i am being totally honest here, it works well enough, at least for me. All i wanted to see was a typical Michael Bay movie, something like Armageddon or the first Transformers, and what i got was a pleasant surprise.\n\nSo, before watching the movie its probably not a sin to say that we were certain of one thing: it couldn&apos;t have been worse than Revenge of the Fallen, which, lets be honest, was pretty atrocious. This time we&apos;ve got plot linked to Moon and Apollo 11, which was clever and worked well for the movie, decepticons taking over the world and turning Chicago into something we&apos;re used to see in The Terminator movies and autobots with their human allies resisting them. Oh, and what we don&apos;t have is Megan Fox. Thank God for that. The new female lead, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley has one task: be pretty and well its safe to say that she succeeds at it, no one expects her to deliver an award-winning performance, but she did really good (it&apos;s her first film by the way) and she fits in the movie and with Sam very well. \n\nAnyway, the film is much bigger and more serious than the previous ones. This time we&apos;ve got emotion and character, which maybe has something to do with, again having Steve Jablonsky and Linkin Park for soundtrack. Iridescent which is played at some points creates an excellent aura. All this decepticon destruction and &quot;drawing the bigger picture&quot; motive provides us with more seriousness and depth.\n\nSo all in all, Transformers: Dark of the Moon was an awesome watch. It could be for anyone, if only one goes to watch it for the right reasons (needlessly to say explosions, CGI and 3D). We&apos;ve got fast pace, a lot of visuals, romance, a lot of mayhem and well, a moral (presented heavily with clich\u00e9s but, hey, no harm). All of which are vital components for a solid summer blockbuster and a clear head to define Transformers as something more than meets the eye. Just sit back and expect a fun and adventurous ride and you won&apos;t be disappointed.",

    "reviewBody": "Of course, &quot;I Am Number Four&quot; is by no means a great movie. Characters are stereotypical, things fall into place way too conveniently and one has the feeling that a good junk of the original novel has just been crammed together to (barely) fit into the running time of 90 minutes. The story feels a bit weak and there are so many plot holes it takes away part of the enjoyment like if the nine aliens are so powerful, why can&apos;t they stop those Mogadorians? Is it because they have a huge flying squirrel like monster? Oh wait. Number Four also have one of those. Is it their appearance? Or is it unexplained? I&apos;ve never read this book before. Lack of narratives? They never mentioned why kill them in sequence. But however, This is not a bad film. It&apos;s just not that great. Among the good points, the visuals were astounding. The final battle in the movie is something that save the movie from being a huge disappointed. The last 20 minutes will most certainly entertain the majority of audiences. And also the villains are pretty cool. There gigantic, bald, covered in tattoos with gills and sharp teeth, carry some pretty cool weapons, and have 2 gigantic beasts as pets.\n\nThe main problem is the movie is totally clich\u00e9d. I mean how many times are we going to see the exact same story. I mean this was your typical teen drama\u0085.new kid..shady past\u0085 weird and wants to stay to himself, but there&apos;s always some cute chick who he risks everything for. There&apos;s always bullies who hate that he&apos;s got the attention of the cute chick, so they always end up having a conflict. I mean 90% of this movie was your typical high school drama teen movie. And the &quot;discovering&quot; of his powers was like the alien version of spiderman. I will say I was interested and intrigued when the film was attempting to do something with the plot and overarching story, but these moments are never given the chance to fully develop.\n\nThis Twilight series&apos; formula might cheer up the hearts of teenage girls, but males with an ounce of testosterone will grow increasingly restless as they await the arrival of the action that the film&apos;s trailer promised. I was intrigued from the early moments in the film where it started to set the plot into motion, and the need for John and Henri to keep running to avoid death. But then it suddenly shifts from a science fiction tale to a romantic love story, and totally loses anything it has going for it. A last minute save in the final act of the film where it shifts back into the realm of sci-fi in the form of a machina known as Number Six (Teresa Palmer) who proceeds to kick a satisfying amount of rampage against the backdrop of CGI and special-effects, is not nearly enough to make up for well over an hour of melodrama and teen angst.\n\nActing wise, Alex Pettyfer is just plain with no expression but of course teenage girls will love him for his looks and physique. Dianna Agron is pretty and acts fine. Teresa Palmer who I adored in The Sorcerer&apos;s Apprentice looks great but barely gets enough screen time to make an impact with little dialogue. Kevin Durand as the Mogadorian Commander is good in his evil act. But one of the film&apos;s biggest disappointed is the misuse of Timothy Olyphant as Henri. The film criminally under-uses Olyphant, the only actor who actually acts in the entire film, and makes him into an almost useless background character. We&apos;re told that he&apos;s a Lorien warrior, and as such you&apos;d expect him to join in the butt- kickery. Unfortunately, he&apos;s only involved in one fight and is inexplicably kidnapped. His role is more of a babysitter for Number Four than a warrior/guardian who dispenses valuable training and wisdom. And then there&apos;s the relative newcomer Callan McAuliffe stuck in the clich\u00e9- ridden role as the know-it-all geek of a best friend though he&apos;s fine in whatever he has.\n\nAll this said, though this movie isn&apos;t the best action film of the year, its still worth a watch for the CGI and the last act of the movie. This is the first installment of the probable trilogy or more. So let&apos;s just hope they do it right in the sequels. I rate it 5.5 out out 10.",

A few months later, a new group of kids, including one of the former kid&apos;s brother, goes to visit their friend who lives near the scene of the murder, however, they don&apos;t know that a murderer is stalking them and killing them. Okay, I thought for sure that this film was going to be horrible. Seriously, how could a remake of one of the most popular slasher flicks of all time be good? Well, I was wrong! It was surprisingly pretty good, and kept me entertained through the whole thing. The acting wasn&apos;t the best (Most of the women actors, besides Danielle Panabaker, were hired because they looked good naked, not because of their acting abilities.) The plot was okay, but I mean, hey, your expectations cannot be too high when you&apos;re watching a Friday the 13th, movie, you just have to go for the ride! All in all, it was a pretty good movie!\n\nRated: R for Violence, Sex, Nudity, Profanity, and Drug Use\n\nGrade: C-",

It&apos;s a stirring and moving story full of twists and turns ; however being pretty claustrophobic . This exciting picture contains thrills, chills, plot twists, action-filled and lots of gore and guts . The movie centers on a Detective named Aidan Breslin (Dennis Quaid) , an expert on forensic Odontology , as his chief (Chelcie Ross) assigns him to investigate a weird chain of murders that bear a rare marks on trees and surrounding. The ominous killings have a rare phrases as \u00a8 We are nothing \u00a8 from Exodus 1,5 and \u00a8Come and see\u00a8 , as he finds out it proceeds from Book of Revelation of the apostle Saint Joan . Meanwhile , Aidan holds a problematic relationship to his oldest son named Alex ( Lou Taylor Pucci) . Investigating a series of murders of strange violence, he discovers a horrifying link between himself , his dark secrets and the suspects that seem to be based on the Biblical prophecies dealing with the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse: War, Famine, Pestilence, and Death ; resulting to be the leader a horseman riding a white horse. Breslin is helped by a tough inspector ( Henry Collins Jr) and a forensic expert ( Barry Shabaka).\n\nIn the picture there are psychological issues , plot twists, emotion, mystery , spooky sets and a little bit of gore. The movie turns out to be a crossover between the religious intrigue from \u00a8Crimson rivers : Angel of Apocalypse \u00a8 , the suspension tortures from \u00a8The cell\u00a8, investigations means of \u00a8CSI\u00a8, and \u00a8Seven\u00a8 thriller. From the beginning of the film until the end the suspense and intrigue is unstopped . The creepy images of wide range from the genuinely eerie to the bizarre along with scary and amazing frames . It&apos;s predictable but also its predictability is redeemed for some extraordinary surprises and in part by the charismatic acting from the main protagonists . Acceptable performance by Dennis Quaid as unlucky Inspector who distances from his two sons and good support cast formed by Ziyi Zhang, Patrick Fugit , Peter Stormare , Eric Balfour and Paul Dooley , among others . Thrilling musical score fitting to action and tension by Jan Kaczmarek who formerly won an Academy Award for \u00a8Finding Neverland \u00a8. The flick is middlingly directed by Jonas Akerlund , a Videoclip-maker in his first and only picture. The movie obtained a bit of success but failed at the box office. Rating : 5,5 . The motion picture will appeal to religious thriller buffs and dark atmosphere enthusiasts.",

That said, the film has a few dozen major breakdowns, not the least of which is attempting to imitate in one way or another far better films, The Ring, The Sixth Sense, The Exorcist, The Omen, and a host of minor films that had essentially the same jump scenes but did them much better. They did try to put together a cohesive movie and gave us the gift of Ms. Annabelle as noted and for that I think it is worth a middling value. You can do better and you can do worse.",

    "reviewBody": "Maybe, my expectations of this film were set too high. Frankly, I pondered why anyone would want to re-make what many genre fans (and movie buffs in general) already consider to be a cult-classic. Didn&apos;t anyone learn a thing about what usually happens to those who try to reinvent a classic (i.e. the poorly attempted re-make of &apos;Psycho&apos;, anyone?).\n\nFor those of you whom have seen the original 1986 &apos;Hitcher&apos;, it is best to leave your experience to that. The characters in this 2007 version barely conjure up a heartbeat, much-less able to hold the viewers attention for more than a few mere minutes at a time! \n\nThat is not to say that the lack of dramatic affect is due solely to sub-par actors. It&apos;s complacency and sterileness is mostly due to a lack of vision and direction, rather than for a lack of competency on any of the actors behalf. Also, severely lacking is the film&apos;s score, which was a haunting staple in the original version, but which is barely of notice in this version.\n\nDid the &apos;Hitcher&apos; require a reattempting? The answer is clear: No. The producer&apos;s of this film also produced the &apos;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&apos; reduxs and while those films were successful both artistically as well in terms of box office dollars, their attempt here is quite unsuccessful at attempting to recreate the nerve-pounding suspense that only the original appears to be able to offer.\n\nDo not slow down. Drive past this one and don&apos;t even bother taking a second glance.",

Many of the current crop of splatter films are played intentionally cheesy for humor. Which is fine, but they shouldn&apos;t ALL be like that. This movie has some humor in it, but it&apos;s a darker humor, and not meant to be cheesy or campy.\n\nEverything that comes to mind when you hear the words &quot;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; is in this movie. No wussing-out in this one! Murder, torture, cannibalism, insanity and a touch of the surreal. Oh yeah, and a chainsaw. No punches are pulled, so this flick is not for the squeamish.\n\nTonally it wasn&apos;t as surreal as the original, but it had a better (read: creepier) tone than the 2003 remake. Plenty of blood and guts. R. Lee Ermey plays a major character instead of a bit-player like in the 2003 remake, and the film benefits from this.",

Jordan wins the lottery, and Lincoln accidentally finds the scary truth behind the utopist award.\n\n&quot;The Island&quot; is an original, intriguing and scary view of science, ethic and society in a near future. Using elements of &quot;Logan&apos;s Run&quot;, &quot;Matrix&quot;, &quot;Gattaca&quot; and &quot;The Thirteenth Floor&quot;, among other sci-fi movies, and non-stop action, it is a surprisingly great film. I liked very much the amoral behavior of Dr. Merrick (Sean Bean), with a total lack of ethic, and the possibility of replacement parts raised in the story. Scarlett Johansson and Ewan McGregor shows a good chemistry, and watching this sci-fi / action movie is worthwhile, even to think how cloning process shall be discussed by the society and controlled through well-studied laws. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;A Ilha&quot; (&quot;The Island&quot;)",

    "name": "Decent enough for Amityville and haunted house film fans, otherwise approach with caution",
    "reviewBody": "A remake of the film by the same name from 1979, which was based on Jay Anson&apos;s book about a supposedly &quot;true&quot; haunting, Amityville Horror begins in familiar territory by showing us Ronald DeFeo, Jr. (Brendan Donaldson) murdering his family. A year later, newlyweds George (Ryan Reynolds) and Kathy Lutz (Melissa George), with three kids from her previous marriage in tow, buy the vacant house at a steal, although they hesitate a bit once they learn why it&apos;s so cheap. Strange occurrences begin not long after they settle in. George becomes increasingly impatient and hostile, daughter Chelsea (Chloe Moretz) begins seeing the dead DeFeo girl, and so on. The film recounts their very brief but tumultuous stay at the home the Lutz&apos;s believed would be their dream home, but which turned into a nightmare.\n\nAfter seeing the remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003), which had the same production team, principal scriptwriter and visual effects team, and which I loved--I gave it a 10--I was completely psyched for the Amityville Horror remake. After all, unlike my view of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), which I also gave a 10, I think the 1979 Amityville has more than its share of problems. I like the original in spite of that, but producer Michael Bay and crew had plenty of opportunity for improvement. Unfortunately, although some aspects of this remake are better in my view, it suffers from a host of new problems. Like the first, the assets are good enough to transcend the flaws so that it squeaks by with a very low &quot;B&quot;, or an 8.\n\nIn my view, there are two primary problems, with at least one a bit ineffable. The more effable problem is that relative newcomer director Andrew Douglas (his previous effort was 2003&apos;s relatively little-known documentary Searching for the Wrong-Eyed Jesus) instructs cinematographer Peter Lyons Collister to shoot the film using way too much close framing. I repeatedly felt the urge to take a couple steps back so I could better discern the action, the settings, the staging of scenes, and so on.\n\nThe second problem lies more in the realm of writing and editing--the film just doesn&apos;t seem to flow right. The transition from scene to scene often feels almost arbitrary. Even though Reynolds does a great job in his transformation as George Lutz (and the acting is superb all around), there was a sense of buildup in the original that this remake is missing. Further indicative of the transition problems, although seemingly minor, is the fact that the date, or the day of the Lutz&apos; stay at the home, is sometimes given as a title and sometimes not. It seems like they just forgot to add the day titles for half of the scenes. Overall the final cut gives an impression of being hastily put together.\n\nAnd that&apos;s a shame, because there is a lot of potential here. The house itself is impressive, as it needs to be, and the overall style of the film is nicely atmospheric. I was also impressed with the production design by Jennifer Williams, which among other assets tends to have the period setting spot-on. For example, I was a huge Kiss, Alice Cooper, etc. fan during this era (and I&apos;m still a fan). Williams has a number of Kiss and Cooper images in the film. She very carefully ensures that none are anachronistic. \n\nEven though scriptwriter Scott Kosar disappointingly expressed a lack of enthusiasm for Anson&apos;s book and the original film, he reintroduces a number of elements from the book that work well, but which were left out of the original film. He also introduces new scenarios that in some cases are among the best material of the film--such as a breathtaking sequence on the roof of the home, and the extension of the mythology behind the &quot;haunting&quot;. He also greatly improves on sequences such as the babysitter. But on the other hand, he inexplicably changes core elements of the story, like the kind of being that Jody is.\n\nAnyone frustrated with the typical horror style of the later 1990s and early 2000s may find this remake troublesome. As one might expect with Michael Bay producing, Douglas is encouraged to use &quot;MTV-styled&quot; cinematography and editing. There are a number of extended techniques that have become somewhat clich\u00e9d in recent years. Douglas has characters do that fast headshaking movement ala Jacob&apos;s Ladder (1990). There are sections shot in a cinema v\u00e9rit\u00e9 style. There are instances of quickly changing film stocks and processing methods, and so on. Even though I usually love all of that stuff, and I&apos;m actually a fan of Bay&apos;s work, I have to agree that it&apos;s not exactly the most natural fit in this case. But for me, it&apos;s not something I would subtract points for either.\n\nMaybe the most surprising fact is that this version of Amityville Horror is so close, structurally, to the original. There is nothing here that is a big surprise, and anyone who has seen the 1979 film a number of times will know exactly what&apos;s coming next, or close enough to it. Whether this is positive or not depends on your opinion of the original film, and just how highly you cherish originality for its own sake. Big Amityville fans and big haunted house film fans will probably enjoy the film enough. Everyone else should approach with more caution.",

    "reviewBody": "It is very safe to say that the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre(1974) was a cultural phenomenon for horror movies and helped change the shape of the entire genre. The movie provided all the essential elements that are vital in horror movies because when it comes down to it, these elements come from what the people want to see. We want to see the twisted things in our imaginations and nightmares come to life and what I love about TCM is it is something that could really happen to you. Sure the movie is a little cheesy now and I think Franklin was hilarious, but its the direction that counts. To me Leatherface is the greatest killer of all time, I like him better than Freddy. I love him because he is very stripped down, he&apos;s not supernatural and reacts to pain like any normal human would. He has all the essentials such as a very creepy image and psychotic behavior. Nobody can hold a candle to Leatherface.\n\nOk enough of that, let me get on to the review of the REAL Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I will not say anything about the story because I want everyone to see it for themselves while knowing very little about the story. It takes a lot for a movie to impress me when the anticipation level is hitting the sky because I expect so much and usually always get disappointed, this happened with Terminator 3. With the &quot;new&quot; TCM, it stays true to the roots that made the first one a hit, but this one BLEW me away.\n\nLets start with the cast. Everyone was amazing and fit in perfectly. I had doubts about Jessica Biels at first but now I see her in a brand new light. I could see no ounce of weakness in any of the characters. The moods expressed throughout the movie were flawless and very convincing. The acting plays a huge role because the better the acting, the more real the feel is, thats when you step into the shoes of the people in the movie and live it out with them. This is what makes and breaks movies and I&apos;m proud to say the cast delivered.\n\nThe story line has been totally changed. This story is 100 times better than the original, I was very impressed. There are far more twists and turns and because the storyline has such a high thrill value, it keeps you glued to your seat. Our theater was packed and only 2 people that I know of left for bathroom breaks. I have never seen this happen before with a movie. Anyway, the storyline could not have gotten any better. One reviewer said some of the stuff in the movie was predictable, that is total BS, this movie has so many turns that you have no idea whats going to happen next.\n\nNow onto the star of the movie, LEATHERFACE. I thought nobody could top Gunnar Hansen from the first TCM but Leatherface in the new one is the best one I have ever seen. He is bigger, scarier, meaner, and crazier than ever. He is the main focus as far as enemies go and I think its great, this pretty much paid tribute to him and it shows everyone that he is the guy to be reckoned with. The moment he did the first kill I knew this movie was ON and had a feeling it would top any slasher movie ever made.\n\nIn closing let me say that when this movie ended, A LOT of people started clapping and cheering. I saw no disappointed faces leaving that theater and this was the first movie ever in which my high anticipation was exceeded, let alone met. I don&apos;t care what ANYONE says, the original, while still a classic and will always be in our hearts, can&apos;t even come close to this one. Storyline, imagery, jump scenes, kills, twists etc.., this movie has it ALL and leaves a lasting impression strong enough to make you want to go pay $7.50 all over again and again and again until you get sick of it. Michael Bay, a lot of people doubted you when you signed on to this but I always defended you and let me say, I know you have shut all those people up. Job well done!",

    "reviewBody": "Right up front, let me confess to having been a World War II nut since early childhood.  You may thus understand the depths of my disappointment with this movie.  I believe Roger Ebert said it best: &quot;The Japanese attack an American love triangle.&quot;  I find it inexcusable that such a pivotal event in history, and one as well documented from just about all angles, can come in for such slipshod treatment at the hands of moviemakers, but I guess I shouldn&apos;t be too surprised.  Just let down.\n\nIf the producers can expend so much time, money and effort to make everything look big and splashy, why not go the extra 1/4 mile and make it look *right*?  Spielberg managed it for Saving Private Ryan, even with the somewhat far-fetched plot device.  Flaws abound, and have been pointed out in great depth elsewhere (the most glaring are the guided missile frigates in the harbor, the off-scale appearance of the Oklahoma as she capsizes (with an impossible torpedo hole in her starboard side, which was shielded by the Maryland *and* Ford Island), no mention of Nevada&apos;s dramatic attempt to get underway and subsequent beaching, etc).\n\nTo my legion of fellow critics I say, &quot;read your history before trashing the &apos;token black&apos; Dorie Miller subplot&quot;.  Ship&apos;s Cook 3rd Miller did, in fact, give aid and comfort to West Virginia&apos;s dying captain, did, in fact, man a machine gun for 15 minutes (during which he believed he shot down a Japanese plane) and was, in fact, the first black recipient of the Navy Cross (awarded in early 1942 by Admiral Nimitz).  Aside from the mistaken coffee-service bit (he was actually bagging laundry at the time) that was one of the things the producers got *right*.\n\nFocusing on the Dolittle Raid, I saw only lost opportunities - how Dolittle convinced his superiors to let him fly, the fates of the crews (who flew solo rather than in formation and were scattered all over the place afterwards) and Dolittle&apos;s dejection at the &quot;failed&quot; raid and his subsequent accolades... all of this was jettisoned as the producers got out the Ritz crackers and Velveeta and went for the cheesy, contrived, convenient resolution of the *important* part of the movie, that cockamamie love triangle.\n\nIn sum, so many opportunities, so little follow through.  Rent &quot;In Harm&apos;s Way&quot; for schmaltz, and &quot;Tora Tora Tora&quot; for the attack itself.  Better yet, snag a copy of &quot;At Dawn We Slept&quot;, and read up on the historical tapestry that this movie never really touched."

    "reviewBody": "This movie is my ultimate guilty pleasure. It&apos;s inane, manipulative, has hyperactive cutting, a ton of glaring inaccuracies (pointless to even discuss or debate), and probably 29 other glaring faults. And why in every dramatic slow-mo emo shot are there 3 helicopters flying in unison overhead? What&apos;s the point of having 3 helicopters flying really close together? Who cares! It looks cool. If one day I am having a heartfelt talk with my daughter, I hope there are 3 helicopters flying overhead to really &apos;bring it home&apos; (and Aerosmith performing in the background.)\n\nDespite it all, I still love watching this movie. Anytime it is on TV I can watch it &apos;til the end. Bruce Willis does a great job doing his Bruce Willis &apos;thing&apos; (smart alecky tough guy), and the supporting cast is really great. Steve Buschemi in particular gets the best lines. An awesome assortment of ragtag castoffs (spitting funny one-liners) must save the world- who would have thunk it?\n\nI think Armageddon was actually conceived by suits in a studio office (no really, I read that in a magazine), which is I guess another strike against it. Yet only a bunch of suits could come up with a &apos;high concept&apos; like this (so high it&apos;s basically a parody by itself.) And only a director like Michael Bay could make it. He&apos;s far more suited to these types of movies, rather than big historical epics like PEARL HARBOR (which I really, really disliked.)\n\nI read somewhere once that this movie is as close as Hollywood gets to pure cinema, in that it is basically completely divorced from reality of any kind. Is that good or bad? I don&apos;t know. I do think if you&apos;re going to ditch convention and any semblance to reality, you may as well go all the way. It&apos;s better than having something that is a confused mess that tries to be different things (Pearl Harbor.) There will be no &apos;it could really happen!&apos; here.\n\nSo after all this, believe it or not I am going to give this movie a big fat whopping 8. Why? Because IMO it unabashedly succeeds at what it tries to set out to be, whatever that is. That makes no sense, since I am basically saying by all logical accounts this movie may actually suck, yet I am giving it a 8. But hey I loved this movie.",

The two funniest scenes are when Burnett and Lowery are scaring the hell out of Burnett&apos;s daughter&apos;s date and after the chase scene with the dead bodies and Captain Howard goes off on the two. Absolutely hilarious! My only gripe is that it seemed that the writers were running low on material and resorted to gross-out humor like rats having sex and corpses losing their heads. Not funny. Otherwise it was very funny, due to the amazing chemistry between the two leads. I still prefer the original Bad Boys, but this is still a great time at the movies. 7/10",

It almost got to the level of &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; but it didn&apos;t chart all that much, didn&apos;t get much airplay and it stopped at the Oscar nomination, one of the many times Diane Warren didn&apos;t get it, and it&apos;s a second time a partnership between her and the director was recognised during awards season, with the previous time being the unforgettable theme of &quot;Armageddon&quot;.\n\nNow, Bay and Hill makes of this clip a great companionship to the film by capturing the film&apos;s themes of love and war, mixing scenes starring Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale and Josh Hartnett with Faith Hill interacting in World War II and America 1940&apos;s style scenarios while giving her heart away while lipsynching the song. It gives the viewer the impression that she&apos;s in the movie at times, such carefully constructed were the sets and her hairstyle and looks, brilliantly filmed by Allen Daviau (&quot;Empire of the Sun&quot;, &quot;E.T.&quot; cinematographer).

    "name": "With enough energy to generate an entire city, The Rock will absolutely blow you back into the 90s.",
    "reviewBody": "The 90s was home to a slew of great raw, uncut, action flicks that shot straight for the rated &quot;R,&quot; despite the guarantee that it would make less money than the money-friendly PG-13 rating. While Die Hard and Lethal Weapon may have jump-started this craze, the peak of this was during the next decade, when we saw the likes of Terminator 2, Speed, Face-Off, Con Air, Die Hard: With a Vengeance, The Matrix, Bad Boys, Point Break, Under Siege, True Lies, Desperado, among others (Quite a list I accumulated, eh?). The 90s was certainly a good decade for action fans, but few movies of this genre can quite top the powerful, gripping, and edge-of-your seat action blockbuster The Rock. The name alone sounds powerful, and behind it is two hours of incredible special effects, superb acting, great action set pieces, and good dosage of writing, and Michael Bay on top of his game.\n\nFew action movies carries as much morality and questionable circumstances as this one. In The Rock we follow a furious general (Ed Harris) leading a group of Marines to take control of Alcatraz Island (along with tourist hostages), a location that used to house criminals. Accompanying them are over a dozen missiles that can spell tens of thousands of innocent lives with every blast. However, he isn&apos;t just a trigger-happy man gone crazy, he is a man seeking justice for the dozens of lives he saw taken from warfare without compensation. A villain with a &quot;moral&quot; agenda, yikes. The only hope for the United States is the only man that has ever broken out of that prison (Sean Connery) and a chemical &quot;superfreak&quot; (Nicholas Cage). With the odds obviously against them, the Pentagon is one order away from destroying the entire location regardless of the innocent lives located in the island. Mindless this movie is not, as the stakes are high, there is always a risk of an innocent life going under, and our heroes rarely ever have the scenario under control. It&apos;s just enough to make you squeal in frustration.\n\nWith the tension remaining edgy and the solution never being oh-so-close, we can thank the writers for delivering a slam-bang storyline full of great one-liners, likable characters, and a villain that isn&apos;t as simple to figure out as the average evildoer. The writing staff ranges from the writer of the third Die Hard to even Tarantino. A major reason for the film&apos;s quality is the casting. Sean Connery and Ed Harris are excellent in their roles and Nicholas Cage albeit a few lines does a good job. The supporting staff helps as well, as we see the likes of David Morse, John Spencer, and Cage&apos;s love interest Vanessa Marcil.\n\nUnlike Michael Bay&apos;s latest films, which run from mediocre to just plain bad, he blends plenty of drama and suspense along with action here. As a matter of fact, the first half of the movie is all suspense, as the situation is developed, and the risks are presented. Disregarding a superb car chase, there isn&apos;t much exploding in the first 80 minutes. However, once the protagonists enter the Rock, it all goes on the uphill action swing. We get brutal fights, brutal shootouts, near-misses, double-crosses, triple-crosses, chases, and enough explosions for action fans to sink their teeth into. The funny thing, the two main actors at the time weren&apos;t expected to be in such action. Connery was aging, and Nicholas Cage just didn&apos;t have the look or the attitude for it. Fortunately for us, they proved us dead wrong.\n\nBottom Line: If you want to see a true action classic, The Rock is a great example. Rising above the average action movie and above the decent ones as well, this is by far Michael Bay&apos;s best work and one of the signature flicks of the 90s. Combining tension you can cut with a steak knife with thrills, chills, and plenty of carnage, The Rock has aged well and continues to influence the work of modern action movies and the work of Michael Bay as well. Grab some popcorn and enjoy this ruthlessly clever movie. Recommend to the max, as long as you don&apos;t mind a bit of blood spewing onto the screen. They just don&apos;t make em&apos; like they used to.",

    "reviewBody": "Meat Loaf as a vampire beast. In love with a very pretty girl who we see running through the forest. Fugitive Meat Loaf on a motorcycle being pursued by police. There&apos;s this castle...\n\nI began collecting music videos featuring pretty girls back in the Late Eighties. Of course I had a preference for solo girls and girl groups, but I also went for the titles featuring models appearing on the screen.\n\nCutting that long story short, let me just say that I was flabbergasted when I first saw this lavishly-filmed mini- masterpiece. I wasn&apos;t used to music videos that were mini-movies. I couldn&apos;t believe my eyes that something that good appeared on the scene in my field.\n\nThis one set a whole new standard.\n\nI have for years searched to find this on DVD. I have stood in a supermarket with baited breath, &quot;ah, Bat Out Of Hell - now for the acid test - read the track list on the back cover.&quot; Then, Aw damn, all hopes shattered, it&apos;s everything but the one track I am looking for. Dejected as I put it back on the shelf. I&apos;d have paid ten times the already high price. I still would. More than ever.\n\nYears later on the Internet* I found a Meat Loaf compilation that looked so promising, the title was included, but I couldn&apos;t be sure if it was the original video. Only way to know for sure was to order it. But no, turned out it was a concert performance. Curses, back to the drawing board.\n\n*yeah, I downloaded it. But a download doesn&apos;t have shop quality. And the downloaded sound of this particular title comes out kinda scrawny and doesn&apos;t do the song justice. Back in my VHS days, I had it loud and proud with the motorcycle sound raw and Mr. Meat Loaf belting it out.\n\nWhy is this jewel so exclusive? Extensive searches on the Internet failed to find me The Real Thing. I hope I made a mistake, but suspect NOT.\n\nI want the original music video. I WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR it, BUT I WON&apos;T give up.\n\nPlease, if there is anybody out there who can help, please get this message through to the rights-holders. Please.",

I did some research on IMDb and discovered that she had been in this music video with Richard Marx, who is known to me as &quot;one for the pretty ladies&quot; so I downloaded from Tubidy (which has become a commercial jumble) and just watched. It&apos;s good. Unfortunately, not great. The reproduction is in wrong aspect ratio, surefire way to rile me. And although Tawny appears all dreamy doe-eyed and everything, the film lacks real audience involvement. Angel-eyed ANGELIA does merit a watch, the song&apos;s okay, I suppose... but considering the beauty of that young girl (I mean, she is a vision!) there should have been more of her. Less car wrecks, more Tawny?",

It is Very Clearly geared towards Adults, and Adults .....{ Alone } . ___________________________________________________\n\nOK then, having gotten that ( - Very \u2b50 - ) crucial &apos;little&apos; detail out of the way, let&apos;s get started. The plain truth of the matter is, that I set out to watch &quot;Birds Of Prey&quot; , got held up in some seriously unexpected, mad, traffic ; and ended up having to settle for &quot;Bad Boys III&quot;, instead. As you&apos;ve no doubt gathered by now, I&apos;d not been much of a stickler for said franchise, prior to this . But, being the { - Die Hard - } &quot; Fun Lovin&apos; \ud83d\ude0e \ud83d\udcfd Film-Junkie &quot; that I&apos;ve ( pretty much - Always ) been, I found myself quietly leaping at the opportunity to &apos; unravel &apos; the mystery behind this Film&apos;s &quot;Pleasantly Surprising&quot; 7.3 \ud83c\udf20 IMDb Audience-score { given that - ( seemingly ) - far better films have done &apos;stunningly&apos; worse..... with the very same crowd ( - broadly speaking - ) } .\n\nAnd here&apos;s what I found. It&apos;s no Oscar contender, that&apos;s for damn sure. However, it is { - Undeniably - } spearheaded by some &apos;Seriously Strong&apos; Performances ( And Joe Pantoliano \ud83d\udd25 , Kate Del Castillo &amp; Jacob Scipio jump to mind - Immediately- when I say that ).... &amp; some &quot;Dangerously&quot; Potent &amp; - Capable - Eye Candy ( in the form of Paola Nu\u00f1ez And Vanessa Hudgens&apos; Miami Cops..... from a - Very Refreshingly - less &apos;Gung-Ho&apos; special forces mini division known, rather ironically, as &quot;A.m.m.o&quot; ). Indeed, the film is borne of a Thoroughly { - Curious - } &quot; Profane, Dramatic, Unpredictable, &amp; - of course - Comedic \ud83e\udd42 \ud83e\udd23 \ud83e\udd23 &apos;Cocktail&apos; &quot; of : 1. Massive Action Scenes , 2. Truly &quot; Fresh &quot; Storytelling , 3. Pure Chaos ; &amp; Yes... { - even - } 4. A Degree Of Spirituality, as well {\u2757} .\n\nSo Much So, that it indeed leaves you believing that Hollywood &quot;Can Actually&quot; ( - At Times, Atleast - ) be comfortable with being seen to be &apos;genuinely&apos; attempting to do it&apos;s - &apos; Very Own &apos; - fair share of &quot; Soul-Searching &quot; - { Within The Context Of The Film Itself } - resulting in the ( &quot; Credible &quot; ) infusion of Powerful Messages of Friendship, Hope { - &amp; Even - } &quot; Redemption \ud83d\ude07 &quot; . . . . . into some of its ( Major ) &apos;Mindless-Fun Type&apos; Action-Blockbuster Offerings.\n\nMy Summation : &quot; I Hadn&apos;t Laughed So Hard Since The Lighter Moments In &apos;JoJo Rabbit&apos; . { - Nor - } Did I Necessarily Find Martin Lawrence &apos;Unbearable&apos; .

The pilot was likable and the further episodes kept getting better and better. The dialogues were fine and i think the overly-sophisticated English would really contribute to young viewers their vocabulary. However, the only thing that bothered me is that even tho they are all in a closed community, it seems a bit odd that the aliens have mastered the English language but they are unaware of everything that takes place outside of their community. But still, i have seen progress through the episodes and it might be worth for you folks to try it out as well. I can assure you that you will not be disappointed. Take it from someone who is very selective on what to watch. This show. A 7.0 from yours truly.",

The characters (and situations) are far too superficial, to the point that you really don&apos;t care what happens to them.\n\nPriestley and Picoy, while undeniably photogenic, come across as Sinatra/Martin wannabes and, of course, they fail miserably, while the two other, lesser, characters making up the group are just annoying most of the time.\n\nIf you want class watch DINER, if you want cool watch Sinatra&apos;s OCEAN&apos;S 11, if you want to be bored watch this."

    "reviewBody": "Giving this movie a 3 out of 10 is being very nice. This not so typical TV movie was originally done for CBS and is a cruel fate for an interesting and sad story of murder in the South. Its a shame for the family of the victims that this is the version that was presented for those unfamiliar with the story. \n\nBoth the director and writer were TV veterans that were in the twilight of their careers, and both coincidentally died 3 years after this movie was made. Its hard to say what&apos;s worst with this train-wreck, the direction or the writing. With its horrible editing, badly performed scenes and clunky dialog, it&apos;s a close race. The acting wasn&apos;t much better than the script, but you can&apos;t blame the actors given what they had to work with, in bad made for TV movies they usually go hand in hand. One possible exception was with one of the villains played by Brad Dourif, who gave one of his usual creepy and effective performances, too bad it was all at the end of the movie. I have to also mention and give an honorable mention to the annoying early 80s synthesized sound track, that added the perfect touch to this unwatchable masterpiece. It would have been a typical and average soundtrack if done in 1980, too bad it was done in the late 80s. Bad made for TV movies were a dime a dozen in the 70s and 80s and this one is no different. They filled in the slack time for the big 3 networks and where effective for the low money spent to get the low ratings they received. Unfortunately a replacement was found for them in the endless bad reality TV we now sit through. I guess pick your poison, I personally pick the endless investigative TV news shows of the 90s.",

    "reviewBody": "What can I say about Miami Vice that hasn&apos;t already been said, except that it is the greatest TV show ever made in the history of television. It quite obvious the best season of Miami Vice is the first season. Season one was the season where Vice really focused all it&apos;s episodes in real life situations. Situations which really happen in real life. Vice started with a bang with the excellent pilot episode, and it never looked backed for the next 22 episodes. Season one was everything that made Mimai Vice what it is now. Action, drama, intensity, thrills , music, style, and relationships. One episode that features all this, is Calderone&apos;s Return- Part 1 and 2. Two really fantastic episodes. Other great episodes of season 1 are The Great McCarthy, Little Prince, Milk Run, I can go on and on. One truly classic season. \n\nAs good as Season 2 was and it was good, it doesn&apos;t compare to Season 1. The problem with season 2, is the show focusing on bizarre situations such as voodoo, satanism, and other weird stuff. Season 2 featured three episodes that I consider awful. Whatever Works, Tale of the Goat, and Bushido. Three episodes that season 1 would of never of thought of making. Even though I don&apos;t like these episodes, I still consider season 2 a very good season. It just doesn&apos;t even come close to the flawless season 1. I do think though that season 2 features the greatest Miami Vice episode of all time which is The Prodigal Son. A well directed, very entertaining Vice episode that features lots of action, drug busts, romance, and totally awesome 80&apos;s music. Your not a real Vice fan if you don&apos;t like The Prodigal Son.\n\nIt&apos;s sad to say, out of all five seasons of Vice, only the first two seasons defy what Miami Vice was and are the only two seasons that really kick Miami Vice ass!! Season 3 became more of a darker Vice that took away everything that made the first two seasons such a highly entertaining show. Gone was the pastel background colors, snappy pop tunes, and Crocketts famous look that made him an icon among men and his fast wheeling car. Dark broody colors were replaced in the background, the music was replaced with unknown artists, and Crockett looked more like a banker/rock star, and his beloved Spider Ferrari was replaced with a Testarossa. Which was blown up in the season premiere of season 3 When Irish Eyes are Crying.\n\nSeason 3 took out all the fun and excitement of the first two seasons and replaced it with a more darker depressing Miami Vice. The outcome, ratings dropped, and the show was not Miami Vice that everyone fell in love with. I think the problem lies with the shows producer John Nicolla, who left and was replaced by Dick Wolf who probably was never in favor of the pastel energetic Mimai Vice of the first two seasons. So if anyone is to blame of Vice&apos;s downfall, it&apos;s Dick Wolf. Creator also of the lame Law and Order series. \n\nI have nothing to say about seasons 4 or 5 except that was this really Miami Vice the show that was unlike any other in the history of television. I have nothing good to say about seasons 4 or 5, except horrifically awful, especially season 4. Can&apos;t get any worse than that.\n\nThere is great news though as of this writing Miami Vice is finally being released on DVD. Season 1 that is. The complete season of all 22 episodes and it&apos;s original music intact. Wow what a collection that will be, I can&apos;t wait. Presume to come out later this year, around Christmas time. What a Christams present that will make! Miami VICE LIVES ON!!! THE GREATEST DAMN SHOW EVER MADE IN THE HISTORY OF TELEVISION!!!"

Not only was Harry Anderson and John Larroquette excellent in their roles along with back up characters like Richard Moll, Markie Post, Charles Robinson, Florence Halop, Marsha Warfield, and Mike Finneran. Often times great, with great guest performances by the likes of Dick Butkus and Mel Torme, this was one of those Golden Oldie sitcoms that should be considered one of the patron saints of the medium. Nowadays, most sitcoms die and fluster, but this one was excellent from the start. Hopefully, a special set with all of the episodes will be released someday, because I will most certainly get this set."

    "reviewBody": "&quot;Max, hide the beers. I mean, who gives a sh*t, man. The whole van smells like pot and alcohol.&quot;\n\nSeeing the title of this movie, it inevitably made me think of the legendary polish product, used to remove stains. I must admit that as the film progresses, and especially during the rough and gore climax in the end, they sure could use a load of this product to remove the resulting stains (blood stains that is). Eventually, the initial meaning of the movie title will be a reference to the fact that the entire film almost solely takes place in a van. &quot;VANish&quot; surely can be considered as a low-budget film that was made in an unreal short period. In 13 days they&apos;ve made the whole thing and in a way you&apos;ll notice that.\n\nDespite the low budget, the film still looks surprisingly fresh and professional. In terms of images anyway. The sultry and hot desert environment where everything happens, shimmers of the screen. Everything is soaked in warm colors. And although it&apos;s a simple story that was filmed in a driven way, there are some shortcomings in it. I&apos;m a fan of low-budget movies. And after watching all these million dollar blockbusters, it&apos;s sometimes a relief to see a minimalist creation. It&apos;s the purity of such movies that intrigue me and not the dizzying special effects or the exuberant paid movie stars who appear in it. That this film won&apos;t be nominated for an Oscar is obvious of course, but usually there is still a revelation to discover in such a creative product. In &quot;VANish&quot; this is without a doubt the actress Maiara Walsh who plays brilliantly the part of Emma: a brave young lady who, even though she finds herself in a dire situation, continues to provoke and belittle the three kidnappers. A funny rendition that guarantees hilarious conversations now and then.\n\nAnother highlight is the brief appearance of Tony Todd, who I&apos;ll always remember as the imposing and frightening &quot;Candyman&quot; from the eponymous movie. A central interlude so absurd that it made me think of &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and the character of Todd as intimidating as ludicrous. I&apos;m sure Tarantino could appreciate this fragment. Besides that, I think you can compare &quot;VANish&quot; with &quot;From Dusk Till Dawn&quot; (except that the latter with regard to the finishing touch and elaboration surely is from a different level). At first glance you might think that this is yet another Danny Trejo one-man-show. Are you a hardcore Trejo fan, then you&apos;ll be deeply disappointed, because he appears only for a few minutes (which I didn&apos;t regret). He might be a crucial part of Jack&apos;s (Austin Abke) established plan, but the final emphasis is on the interaction between the four protagonists and the hidden agenda of Jack.\n\nThe biggest disappointment was the denouement. In line with the slasher films of the 90s, this film ends in a huge bloodbath and the shown violence reaches excessive proportions. But ultimately, these violent scenes aren&apos;t really innovative and they look just as old as those of the good old days. Nevertheless you would expect them to be more realistic and credible with today&apos;s technology. It seemed as if the staff used buckets of fake blood on the set. Also, the three kidnappers Jack, Max and Shane were at one time really irritating. Admittedly, Shane (Adam Guthrie) and Max (Bryan Bock Brader, Director) weren&apos;t really sane (drugs, alcohol and PTSD are most likely the cause of this), but gradually they became more and more schizophrenic and hallucinatory insane. In contrast, Jack is an example of self-control. That&apos;s why a visit to his angry girlfriend, who broke up with him for unknown reasons, during the abduction is plain normal (for me this was a bit exaggerated).\n\nPerhaps the biggest plus of this film is the simplicity of the story: two perfectly normal looking weirdos (a kind of &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot;-types) abduct the daughter of a drug baron for ransom, the trip to the meeting is fairly chaotic, one of the kidnappers seems to have a different motivation, the denouement turns out to be quite bloody. And that&apos;s perhaps the downside of the film. A too simplistic story. Perhaps they should have extended that period of 13 days a little, to embellish the story a bit and improve the gore, bloody scenes. The movie isn&apos;t that bad, but maybe they rushed it a bit as if all hell would fall on them.\n\nMore reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be",

There was enough thrill and suspense to keep me interested but no so much gore that I was turned off and even a bit of humor which definitely helped me to settle down after the scares. The actors and actresses did a fantastic job and the storyline was good. I would have loved to have more back story with regard to the tension between the two main characters, but that&apos;s just my personal preference as drama is my preferred genre. Overall good show! Great job everyone!"

    "name": "Really Well-Made Film. Not for the Fast n&apos; Furious Crowd",
    "reviewBody": "Once again, Chandor gives us a well-written, well-acted, beautifully photographed film, on a relatively small budget, that winds up being incredibly watchable. I would say he&apos;s done this with all 3 of his films. None of them were action-packed film, but that all had a truth and reality to them, that really pulled me in.\n\nI&apos;ve read some reviews on here that complain that the film was too slow for them or that it was &quot;boring.&quot; Look, despite it&apos;s title (which may have mislead a lot of viewers going in), this film is not for the Fast and Furious or Transformers crowd. It&apos;s not even for people who loved the blood-soaked Scarface. \n\nIt portrays violence and the fear of running a business in NYC in the early 80s, in a very real way. And it captures the early 80s look flawlessly. \n\nThis film may, however, be be for people who loved films like The Godfather or DePalma&apos;s Dressed to Kill. Not only does Oscar Issac seem to channel bits of Michael Corleone, but the film is lit and photographed in a very similar manner to the way that Gordon Willis shot The Godfather. Also, for those who think there was a ton of action and killing in the Godfather, outside of the final few minutes, there really isn&apos;t. Though very different films, what pulls you into the Godfather and Dressed to Kill is similar to what pulls you in here. Tension, honesty, a simple story, well told. No BS. No shooting up a whole town, with dead bodies falling everywhere, and then cutting to the next scene at dinner. \n\nIn real life, violence is frightening, finding a gun is frightening, shooting a gun at someone is frightening, having your life savings at stake, and the fear of losing everything you&apos;ve worked for is frightening. Chandor pulls this all together to build tension, and it results in a very satisfying film.",

I loved this movie. The acting was superb, and I think that Ed Harris did an awesome job. I was not bothered by his bald head. Love is love no matter what you look like on the outside. It&apos;s the feelings inside you have for each other that makes you never want to be without that other person. This movie showed how hard it was for Nikki to let go when her husband died so much so that when she met Tom who looked exactly like her deceased husband she went into this fantasy mode pretending he was still with her. I think the realization of what she had been doing when Tom found out that he looked exactly like Garrett shocked Nikki into coming to her senses and finally being able to move forward.",

Some things happen and you are asking yourself &quot;how?&quot; And then the movie explains and you are asking yourself &quot;why?&quot;. The movie is trying too hard to tell a story which is clearly above the calibers and intentions of the director and the production company. A simple young-adult movie in the shoes of Twilight or Hunger Games, nothing more. So please, next time give a warning on the front cover that this is a young adult movie for our young superficial crowd.

Also the great crew members and skits make it worthwhile because Kevin in the Pokemon episode and Frank who played Solid Snake in the latest Metal Gear episode did their parodies brilliantly.

This mostly has individuals who belong in that category, and is an incredibly see-through sensationalist piece that seeks to remind audience members of the case(and yes, six people being murdered is tragic... that doesn&apos;t mean you need anything supernatural for it to happen) in an obvious attempt to drum up attention for the remake. You want the story? Watch the two episodes History&apos;s Mysteries did on it(if you can tolerate the goofy reenactments). This goes through the motions, if even that. And then there&apos;s who I refer to in my Summary... Lorraine Warren. &quot;Interpreter for the dead&quot; is her credited title. I can barely type that crap out. She even ends this by telling the camera that &quot;the best protection the Devil has is a skeptical public&quot;. Is that so? Well, replace the word &quot;Devil&quot; with &quot;powerhungry people who use religion to enforce their selfish ideas upon the rest of the world&quot; and the word &quot;sceptic&quot; with &quot;unquestioning&quot;... yeah.

It consists of interviews, behind-the-scenes footage and clips of the film(that it spoils, note that), being essentially a making-of. They go over various things they did(not many that I can refer to directly, but rest assured that they delve into the major sequences and sets, albeit they don&apos;t cover any pre- or post-production), we hear a bit about the kids(seeing Jodie dance makes her less creepy, though) including from their own mouths(*man* was Moretz a girl back then, wait &apos;til you hear about the Acorn club... I can&apos;t tell you about it myself, the first two rules tell me not to), and I personally loved seeing Rachel in this. There is a bit of the obligatory love-fest about the director(and they only briefly touch upon the fact that it is his first movie, and of course don&apos;t show examples of earlier work or discuss his style)... well, at least they do present arguments for it(he&apos;s good with actors, apparently... and extremely nice(take one guess if that last one was said by an adult or a child)). There is disturbing, violent and bloody content in this. I recommend this to those who enjoyed the flick itself. 6/10",

    "reviewBody": "For a man that is not feeling well, this was the perfect no brainer film to help me conquer those sweats and chills. There was unrealistic fighting, a Swiss cheese plot, and characters that we cared nothing for, which allowed me to doze off and still know what was happening. This was a Steven Seagal film, so I wasn&apos;t expecting much, but honestly, after several of his film you come to realize that they are all very similar and Seagal has not changed his fighting habits at all over the years. He is still using the same fist moves that made him popular in Above the Law. Why should he change? He is Steven Seagal. \n\nSo, take his old-school 1980s fighting techniques and combine it with a modern day rap artist like Ja-Rule (especially after his popularity with DMX in Exit Wounds), and you have the film Half Past Dead. So, let&apos;s begin. The fighting was laughable. I think that if a gust of wind hit Ja-Rule he would fly halfway across the room. Also, why did it become increasingly obvious that Ja-Rule was not doing his own fight sequences? Throughout his fighting with Nia Peeples, it is very clear that it is not Ja-Rule. How could a director allow such a blatant error happen in an action film? This is not the only case of action gone wrong. There are several scenes in which bullets defy their projected path and gravity. Also, let us not forget the flying fists of Seagal which had the sounds of some hard hits, but it was very obvious that he was mock fighting with most of the extras. This unrealistic fighting knocked this film from five stars to four stars.\n\nSo, let&apos;s move past the fighting. What is a good action film without the story to accompany the fighting? Sadly, director Don Michael Paul felt as if there was no story needed. Why bother the audience with a story when we have Ja-Rule and Steven Seagal fighting together on-screen? The plot was riddled with more holes that my high school underwear. It was as if we were not seeing the entire picture, and instead of showing us the director relied on words to tell us. Some examples of what I mean are how Sasha and Nick first met. I needed to see this. Without this story and seeing their trust be born, it became less emotional when it was broken. I didn&apos;t care, I needed to know more about them. The side-story about Seagal&apos;s wife was just filler. He has these visions of her that help him live after a gun battle, but that is all we know about her. When I first saw this scene, I thought it was going to be a major influence in the film. Sadly, I believe that was the last mention of the wife. The Prisoner&apos;s story with the gold was horrible. I didn&apos;t know enough about the guy to make me see the evil in his ways. This ultimately led to an unclimactic ending with this Prisoner. Does anyone really know who Morris Chestnut&apos;s character was? How did he get the money to finance this operation, and how did he become the inside man? I needed answers of which Don Michael Paul was not willing to provide. The lack of story and weakness of the main characters knocked this film from four stars to two.\n\nFinally, I would like to comment on the title. What does it mean? Was it a reference to the time when Sasha almost died, or is it a reference to the lack of caring about life from Ja-Rule and the inmates (remember his line, &apos;Tonight is a good time to die&apos;). I don&apos;t know. This led me to the ultimate conclusion about this film. The director just didn&apos;t care. He was happy to have Seagal and Ja-Rule signed on, so everything else became second fiddle. In the range of action films, this is pretty poor. Unrealistic fighting with an overabundance of clich\u00e9d lines only plummeted this film deeper into the world of action. To be brutally honest, Ja-Rule cannot act, and this became a problem in this film. He needed a smaller film to get his feet wet and see if he was ready for the cinema world. Half Past Dead was not the best role for him. This film is the perfect example of a movie made just to get rap artists some screen time and attempt to bring an overweight action start from the 80s into the new generation. Sadly, in Half Past Dead it didn&apos;t work.\n\nGrade: * out of *****"

They have celebrity guests and the people that are in the news as guests so they can tell their stories on the show. During the week the show is hosted by Mary Hart, Mark Steins, Jan Carl, Vanessa Minnillo, Steven Cojocaru, Leornard Maltin, Carlos Ponce, Paula Abdul, and Kevin Frazier! All of these hosts in My opinion are very talented. What I like about the show is that the hosts go into many details in the news and such. So if you are watching television during the week and want to watch the Hollywood and celebrity news in detail then I suggest that you watch Entertainment Tonight today!"

I love her as anchor. I wish she would contact me as I am undoubtedly her no.1 fan. I think she is great at what she does.As well as the way she does it!Lara, you are great!Keep up the excellent work! You deserve every bit of success you have achieved as you have earned it. I am amazed at how you can take care of 2 kids along with pleasing your husband. Do you exercise 7x a week. Because you look very lean, svelte, and gorgeous all the time. Age has not affected you in the least bit. What is you secret to staying in such great shape?",

For those who have seen it, go watch it again!\n\nKenny Powers, arguably the best character ever created by Danny McBride, shows the audience how life would be when he becomes CEO of K-Swiss. Powers brings on some big names in the sports industry to help him run his new acquisition. Jon &quot;Bones&quot; Jones running the Human Resource Department of any company for example, genius decision Kenny Powers. This is going well and we&apos;re only one minute into this five minute peek into the mind of Danny McBride!\n\nHold onto your seats, this ride might not last long but it delivers more laughs than most full length films!

The one thing I agree with viewers is it&apos;s a bit to inappropriate at times. But there are times when that can be funny. The hosts I enjoy. Kevin is hilarious whenever he torments Candace, who always has something to comeback at him with. Watching The Feed and Gadget Pr0n are my two favorite segments of the show. I am a total nerd (@ times) and watch for new hardware or news about my favored companies. But other than that I don&apos;t pay much attention to anything else on the show unless it catches my interest, like humor. Overall &quot;I give this a 4 out of 5&quot; (9/10)- Chris Hardwick.",

Whereas Cutler&apos;s camera clumsily follows Anna Wintour and the industry&apos;s biggest names, whom are carefully shown to positively cower before her, Varon Bonicos&apos;s camera is an extension of time and space. I know its wrong to compare films as both different but with Fashion film sadly, they all seem to follow the same path ie that of a brand PR extension. The September issue is only really about Vogue and not the technically dreary woman who sees fashion as a business and &quot;The September Issue&quot; a brand extension , director R J Cutler is indeed a great filmmaker, and I feel that under the circumstances his creation was amazing but after seeing Varon Bonicos&apos;s A Man&apos;s Story - oddly underrated breakthrough documentary film about black UK tailor and men&apos;s guru designer Ozwald Boateng - I now retrospectively crave the reality of A Man&apos;s Story in &quot;The September Issue&quot; and indeed in all the fashion documentaries i have watched other than perhaps Valentino&apos;s last. In my opinion Bonicos&apos;s crafted this genius movie without upsetting Mr Boateng and really getting into the heart of Ozwald Boateng&apos;s luxury and golden pillared reality that has become his life. I look forward to Varon Bonicos&apos;s next fashion documentary, perhaps Mr Armani would make sense .RR",

    "reviewBody": "Watching this 2 hour 15 minutes documentary on Transformers 2 reminded me how torn I am on Bay as an artist, a filmmaker. He brings spectacular set-pieces to the screen and delivers some of the best audiovisual stylization in the blockbuster stratosphere. He demands a lot, is extremely difficult to work with but knows exactly what he wants, and everyone is in awe of his workflow.\n\nAt the same time, he is a bit of an idiot in how he gives off a toxic masculinity vibe and how disgusting his racist, misogynistic and jingoistic textual ideas are. He embodies the stereotypical american ignoramus cliche.\n\nSo if you want to get a general feel for how Bay operates, definitely check this out. It&apos;s fascinating as it covers the whole production from beginning to premiere. A bit too much self-indulgence and too many corporate puppets speaking about the toy and cars, and a horrible propaganda chapter about the military literally using these films for recruitment. But thats also what makes this such an interesting document, flawed and fascinating, just as the man himself.",

    "name": "I&apos;ve only seen two of the movies that got nominated for anything!",
    "reviewBody": "Yes, it&apos;s true! I, the ultimate cinephile, have only seen two nominated movies: &quot;I&apos;m Not There&quot; and &quot;Charlie Wilson&apos;s War&quot;. I&apos;ve just been working so much that I haven&apos;t gotten to go to the movies much (and I frankly think that they should have nominated &quot;Grindhouse&quot; for at least something; I mean, they nominated f**king &quot;Norbit&quot; for an Oscar).\n\nBut anyway, on to the review. I really liked that during the pre-awards ceremony with the people arriving, two people made solid statements: Julie Christie wore an ACLU pin to call for the closure of Guantanamo, and Michael Moore apologized to the world for everything that the US has done. I wonder what would happen to anyone who attended the Oscars and called for continuation of the Guantanamo base.\n\nWhen Jon Stewart hosted two years ago, I named him best host ever (at least during my lifetime). This year, his true highlight was noting that despite the lack of recognition for movies about Iraq, we have to stay the course and keep the movies in the theaters...otherwise the audience wins! In fact, Arianna Huffington noted that the Best Picture nominees all sound as though they allude to John McCain: &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot; (election season!), &quot;There Will Be Blood&quot; (his foreign policy), &quot;Atonement&quot; (how&apos;s he explain to his wife all this stuff about the lobbyist?), &quot;Michael Clayton&quot; (he needs a fixer), and &quot;Juno&quot;...well, let&apos;s keep an eye on Vicki Iseman.\n\nThe montages were about what I expected (why do they never show Kevin Kline?). I get the feeling that a lot of the young people watching this see the montages showing people from the days of yore and have no idea who any of them are. Heath Ledger was probably the most recognizable person in the &quot;In Memoriam&quot; montage.\n\nBut like I said earlier, I watched &quot;The 80th Annual Academy Awards&quot; completely numb to most of the nominees. I have no idea whether the winners deserved their wins or not; hell, I&apos;ve never even heard of Marion Cotillard or Robert Boyle. Although you gotta admit, who would have guessed that Best Original Song would go to an Irish movie (&quot;Once&quot;) over a Disney movie (&quot;Enchanted&quot;)? The kind of people whom Stephen Colbert spoofs must have gotten angry about Best Documentary Feature going to one about Iraq (and Best Documentary Short Subject, if I remember right, went to a movie about a same-sex partnership). Of course, these sorts of individuals consider the Oscars an excuse for America-hating, Democrat-backing celebrities to promote the &quot;gay agenda&quot;. In fact, Stephen Colbert should host the Oscars - in his right-wing commentator persona - and bash everyone for being the blame-America-first crowd (because let&apos;s face it: how many movies has Hollywood made saying anything good about the United States?).\n\nAll in all, it&apos;s neat to see Steve Carell, Cameron Diaz, Harrison Ford, Tom Hanks, Helen Mirren, Hilary Swank, Forest Whitaker and the rest doing their stuff. Even though the two movies that I saw didn&apos;t win anything, I still liked the broadcast. Any pet peeves? Well, when they showed Bob Clark in the deceased montage, I think that instead of &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; next to him, they should have shown &quot;Porky&apos;s&quot;; or maybe &quot;Children Shouldn&apos;t Play with Dead Things&quot;.\n\nOverall, I liked it.",

I really like the kinds of guests they have on the show, from Sir Anthony Hopkins to Danny DeVito to Diane Lane and Samuel L. Jackson.  As an aspiring filmmaker myself, I find the ideas talked about on the show to be invaluable and very engaging.\n\nI look forward to many more episodes and especially guests.  I hope they get someone like George Lucas or even Steven Spielberg.  Now that would make for some interesting interviews, just like the one Spielberg had on Lipton&apos;s Actor&apos;s Studio show."

    "reviewBody": "Michael Bay&apos;s THE ISLAND is a special effects action movie, so the DVD provides interviews and various footage in this &quot;making-of&quot; documentary to show the preparation &amp; execution of said FX. It makes more sense than cast interviews and rehearsals (the film&apos;s acting performances were nothing to right home about), but the result is simply another boring &quot;Rah Rah&quot; session of folks patting themselves on the back.\n\nTechnical crew, especially in physical effects and stunt roles, always refer to a movie as a &quot;show&quot; and use other carny-inspired jargon like &quot;gags&quot; to explain what they&apos;re up to. We hear many of the experts that worked on THE ISLAND explain how difficult it all was, and my reaction was: who cares? Their job is to get it right and the film does play well from an action/things blowing up/MTV or TV commercial editing style/attractive sets/impressive CGI standpoint. The fact that it is a pointless, trite and unnecessary followup to classic sci-fi dating back to SOYLENT GREEN seems besides the point.\n\nFor haters, director Michael Bay comes off as the arrogant jerk he is always assumed to be, so at least he gives the &quot;fans&quot; what they want in that department. I tried listening to some of his director&apos;s commentary behind the main feature as well, but it was impossible to stick for more than a few minutes after hearing his self-appointed &quot;visionary&quot; b.s. He has become the symbol for what has ruined mainstream films in the recent couple of decades known as the MTV/Video Era."

    "reviewBody": "Chainsaw Redux: Making a Massacre (2004)\n\n*** (out of 4) \n\nDirector Marcus Nispel, producer Michael Bay and several of the cast and crew members are interviewed for this 76-minute documentary that takes a look at the making of the remake of THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE. This is a pretty darn good documentary that starts off with the outrage that people felt when word got out that the Tobe Hooper classic was going to be remade. There are some funny interviews with fans and then we get to hear some about that 1973 film. We get to hear about its production as well as the huge impact it had on the genre and then we cut to Bay who discusses what the point of remaking it was.\n\nFrom here we learn about the director, what he wanted to do with the film and then we get into casting and various stages of the production. This documentary pretty much covers everything you&apos;d want to know about the film including the music, the special effects and we also get to hear from cast members like Jessica Biel, R. Lee Ermey and Andrew Bryniarski who played Leatherface.\n\nI think the highlight of the thing were the first ten or so minutes when we hear about the original and from the fans who were outraged at it being remade. The majority of the stuff dealing with the remake was good but before long the thing did start to feel too much like a promotional piece with everyone talking about how great everyone was doing. This here did get a tad bit old but if you&apos;re a fan of the film then there&apos;s no question that this is worth watching."

I think most guys would like to go to a playboy party at the mansion, well this is as close as most of us will ever come and you have to take what you can get. There are footage from all the big annual parties they have at the mansion mixed with interviews with some of the famous guests that attend them and quite a bit of film of Hef just going about his business with all the girls around him as usual. I thought it was a pretty good documentary."

    "reviewBody": "This 76-minute behind-the-scenes documentary is broken into five sections: Development, Production, Special-Makeup Effects, Music and Reaction. They all run anywhere from 13 to 21 minutes apiece to give a comprehensive look at this controversial film dealing with the infamous fictional serial killer &quot;Hannibal Lecter.&quot;\n\nPRODUCTION - For Dino DeLaurentis and his daughter Martha, things didn&apos;t look too good at the start. They were dying to make the movie but their direction Jonathan Demme, who did &quot;Silence Of the Lambs&quot; didn&apos;t want any part of this and neither did the star actor, Anthony Hopkins. Mr. Hopkins during this time, you may recall, announced in 1998 he was through with acting. He also read Tom Harris&apos;s&apos; book &quot;Hannibal&quot; and thought it was &quot;too bizarre.&quot; Yet, things worked out as Ridley Scott was talked into reading the book and loved it and agreed to director, and Hopkins changed his mind when he knew they had another great director and a tremendous screenwriter in Steve Z, whom DeLaurentis said &quot;is the best writer in the industry.&quot;\n\nThey weren&apos;t able to retain the services of the other costar of &quot;Silence,&quot; Jodie Foster, but were pleased to get Julianne Moore for the role. Hopkins favored her among five leading candidates because he had prior filming experience with her, and liked her. \n\nIn another interesting note, Hopkins was shown signing autographs as the Italian crowd all swarmed him. &quot;I fee like Mick Jagger or Sting,&quot; Hopkins joked.\n\nPRODUCTION - This dealt with the city of Florence is just magnificent, with its centuries-old architecture, Tuscan hills in the background, just a beautiful place. Actress Francesca Neri said it &quot;is really the heart of Italy.&quot; Filming there was made difficult because of all the tourists. &quot;There are more tourists there, literally, than residents,&quot; someone observed.\n\nThey also showed some interesting shots of the infamous scene in which Ray Liotta&apos;s character is having his brains eaten. Liotta had to make a body cast of himself, so there was a perfect duplicate of him also sitting at the table which we viewers never saw. It was dummy&apos;s brains that were taken, not Ray&apos;s, thankfully! Liotta said it was the eeriest feeling ever to sit there and look at himself across the table. It really freaked him out.\n\nMAKEUP - They all had nothing but highest praise for working with Ridley Scott. The biggest challenge, of course, was the character of Mason Verger. &quot;It was tough; everything wee did looked like a zombie until we finally could get something realistic looking.&quot; commented Greg Cannom, of special makeup effects\n\nPoor Gary Oldman, who had to endure five hours of makeup each time and another one for clothing - six hours of preparation to look like Verger. Also discussed are some of the other big effects scenes, some of them too disgusting to even talk about, like the pigs eating a human. This film was not for the squeamish, as you know, if you&apos;ve seen it.\n\nMUSIC - Hans Zimmer, the composer, is the main man interviewed in this segment. He, too, laughs and jokes and remarks how he enjoys working with Scott. Both men explain how they go about their work and how it affects the film. By the way, check out Zimmer&apos;s resume. I can&apos;t believe how many &quot;name&quot; films he&apos;s scored.\n\nREACTION - This a fun, stargazing segment as we saw all the film participants except Scott (who&apos;s mom had just died) at a premier screening in Hollywood and then another in New York City. There were tons of recognizable faces and the comments by some of actors, like Hopkins, were interesting.",

    "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve been watching a lot of DVD extra features lately and one of the things that I have found that almost all of them have in common is that nearly all of them have distantly lower ratings on the IMDb than they deserve. Consider, for example, the three documentaries included on the Vista Series of The Sixth Sense, which are all outstanding documentaries but which all received collective ratings of something like 3 out of 10, which is absolutely ridiculous.\n\nThis documentary is all of 8 minutes long, I find it hard to believe that people were upset that they just wasted 8 minutes of their life watching it, especially when it does, in fact, give some pretty interesting insights into the motivations of one of the most successful producers of all time (although certainly not the best). I recently watched an old Three Stooges short comedy called The Brideless Groom, the IMDb comments about which were unanimously glowing, despite the fact that the film was tepid and boring. Just like automatic praise for mediocre films damages the authenticity of the truly great films, this seemingly arbitrary lack of respect for interesting introspectives like Conversations with Jerry Bruckheimer simply dilute the stock in which movie-goers can put into the opinions of IMDb users.\n\nI have a healthy dislike of the vast majority of Bruckheimer&apos;s work. His films are crowd-pleasers but not the way that Spielberg&apos;s movies are. He goes for universal appeal but at the expense of the quality of the story that he is telling and the film that he is making, using such methods as heavily structured and contrived plots and, most damaging, by forcing cloying romantic subplots into films which have no room or need for them. Armageddon is an example of a film that had no room, and Pearl Harbor is a film that had no need. Coyote Ugly was one of the few that had no reason for being made in the first place, and while I&apos;m at it, I should admit that to me, The Rock (while also exploitative and contrived) is simply pure entertainment.\n\nIn this short documentary, Bruckheimer talks about some of his experiences in film-making and some of the people that he has worked with, talking about his motivations and goals, as well as the things that he finds rewarding about the entire process, like seeing an audience laugh and cry and simply be entertained. This is the kind of thing that makes me take pause about some of the harsh things that I have said and written about his films, although only long enough really to make me remember that I was right. Bruckheimer is a respectable man, but respectability does not equal great films, nor does having brought in a gross total of $11 billion over your career. As Sidney Lumet notes, commercial success does not denote great film.\n\nClearly, even though I do not have the highest respect for many of Bruckheimer&apos;s films, I am certainly able to look past my low opinion of them and enjoy a look at the motivations of one of the most powerful men involved in their creation. It is indeed interesting to see what motivated someone who came up with something that I so wholeheartedly disagree with, which I think is something to keep in mind when rating something like this on the IMDb. I can certainly understand people being unimpressed with something like Gone in 60 Seconds or Coyote Ugly, but this conversational documentary is not a 1 out or 10 by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nIt is, unfortunately, easier to watch and more enjoyable than many of Bruckheimer&apos;s films.",

    "reviewBody": "Unfortunately, this series has very little new stuff to offer to real movie fans. The series consists of four parts, all dealing with different aspects of the special effects business. The premise sounds interesting enough, but the execution is very poorly done. The individual episodes are built up entirely of promotional footage, with the producers and directors constantly emphasizing how fabulous and groundbreaking their movies are. The only highlight of the series is the episode that tells the history of stop-motion animation and the making of the effects on Jurassic Park. That particular episode is quite fascinating, with comments by Willis O&apos;Brien, Ray Harryhausen and Rick Baker who manage to keep it continually interesting, even though they are constantly interrupted by commercials, that take some of the pace out of it. Watch the show for that episode alone (I think it was the second), the rest of the series is only of moderate interest."
